The above code may or may not contain memory, buffer, or pointer issues, depending on how it is used. However, it does appear to contain a potential security vulnerability related to the use of `strlen()`.

The function `pure_memcmp()` appears to be vulnerable to a timing attack, which can be exploited to leak sensitive information from the memory being compared. The vulnerability arises from the use of a `do...while` loop that repeatedly compares two bytes of memory and ORs them together. This operation has the potential to be accelerated by using specific values of the two compared variables, which can cause the result of the comparison to "wrap around" and reveal additional memory locations.

For example, consider the following modified version of the function:

```c
int vulnerable_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
    const unsigned char *b1 = (const unsigned char *) b1_;
    const unsigned char *b2 = (const unsigned char *) b2_;
    size_t i;
    unsigned char d = (unsigned char) 0;
    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (i == len - 1) {
            d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
        } else {
            d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
            if (d == 0) {
                continue;
            }
        }
        return (int)((1 &((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1);
    }
}
```

In this modified version, we added an additional check at the end of the loop to ensure that the final value of `d` is not equal to zero before returning it. This additional check prevents the result of the comparison from "wrapping around" and potentially leaking additional memory locations.

While this modified version of the function is less vulnerable to a timing attack, it still has a potential information disclosure vulnerability if the length of the compared buffers is not known a priori. In this case, an attacker could potentially cause the function to read beyond the bounds of the input buffers, potentially leading to a buffer overflow and potentially remote code execution.

The function `pure_strcmp()` appears to be vulnerable to a similar information disclosure vulnerability. The function simply calls `pure_memcmp()` with a length of `strlen(s
