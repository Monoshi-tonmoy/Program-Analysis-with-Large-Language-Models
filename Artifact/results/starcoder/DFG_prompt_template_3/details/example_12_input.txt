Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to Demonstrate the\n// Multiplication table of a number\n#include <stdio.h>\nvoid print_table(int range, int num)\n{\n\t// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.\n\tint mul;\n\n\t// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.\n\tfor (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {\n\t\t// To store the product.\n\t\tmul = num * i;\n\n\t\t// Printing the Multiplication Table.\n\t\tprintf(\"%d * %d = %d\", num, i, mul);\n\n\t\t// Proceeding to the next line.\n\t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n\t}\n}\n// Driver code\nint main()\n{\n\n\t// The range of the\n\t// Multiplication table\n\tint range = 10;\n\n\t// The number to calculate the\n\t// Multiplication table\n\tint num = 5;\n\n\t// Calling the Function.\n\tprint_table(range, num);\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```"}]
