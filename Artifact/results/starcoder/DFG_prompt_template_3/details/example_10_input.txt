Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to implement the above approach\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to find factorial of given number\nunsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)\n{\n\tint result = 1, i;\n\n\t// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial\n\tfor (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n\t\tresult *= i;\n\t}\n\n\treturn result;\n}\n\n// Driver code\nint main()\n{\n\tint num = 5;\n\tprintf(\"Factorial of %d is %d\", num, factorial(num));\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```"}]
