Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program for the even or odd\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to check if a \n// number is even or odd\nvoid checkEvenOdd(int N) {\n    // Find remainder\n    int r = N % 2;\n\n    // Condition for even\n    if (r == 0)  {\n        printf(\"Even\");\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise\n    else {\n        printf(\"Odd\");\n    }\n}\n```"}]
