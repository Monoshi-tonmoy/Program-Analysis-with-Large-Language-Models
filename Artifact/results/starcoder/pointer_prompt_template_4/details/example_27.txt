This code snippet has several potential issues:

1. Bad pointer arithmetic: The line `ap = argv` assigns a pointer to the first element of the `argv` array to a pointer `ap`. However, the array `argv` is not null-terminated, so the pointer `ap` will become invalid once it reaches the end of the array. The line `if (++ap >= &argv[10])` attempts to increment `ap` and check if it is greater than or equal to the address of the 11th element of the array (which is not a valid address). This check is unnecessary and can lead to memory corruption or a segmentation fault.

2. Unsafe dereferencing: The line `*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t")` dereferences the pointer `ap` without checking if it is null. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other errors if the pointer is null.

3. Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite: The function `strsep` is a custom implementation that is not guaranteed to be secure. It takes a pointer to a pointer and a separator string as arguments, and it modifies the pointer to point to the next token in the input string. However, the implementation of `strsep` in this code snippet does not properly handle cases where the separator string is a prefix of a token in the input string. In this case, the separator would be removed from the input string, causing a buffer overflow. Similarly, if the separator string is a suffix of a token in the input string, the function could remove characters from the beginning of the input string, causing a buffer underwrite.

4. Bad allocation / deallocation: The call to `free(ap[4])` attempts to free a pointer that was allocated on the stack. This can lead to memory corruption or a segmentation fault.

5. Improper sanitization of input: The code does not properly sanitize user input, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the function `strsep` is not guaranteed to handle null characters in the separator string, which could be used to overwrite memory or inject malicious code. Additionally, the code does not check the return value of `strsep`, which could indicate a failed allocation or a null pointer, which could be used to exploit the program.

Overall, this code snippet has several potential issues, including bad pointer arithmetic, unsafe dereferencing, buffer overflows or underwrites
