Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to implement \n// the above approach \n#include <stdio.h> \n\n// Driver code \nint main() \n{ \n\t// We can change values here for \n\t// different inputs \n\tfloat P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; \n\n\t// Calculate simple interest \n\tfloat SI = (P * T * R) / 100; \n\n\t// Print Simple Interest \n\tprintf(\"Simple Interest = %f\\n\", SI); \n\n\treturn 0; \n}\n```"}]
