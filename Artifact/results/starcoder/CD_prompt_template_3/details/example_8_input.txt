Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to demonstrate the\n// area and perimeter of rectangle\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n\n\tint l = 10, b = 10;\n\tprintf(\"Area of rectangle is : %d\", l * b);\n\tprintf(\"\\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d\", 2 * (l + b));\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```"}]
