Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program for the even or odd\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to check if a \n// number is even or odd\nvoid checkEvenOdd(int N) {\n    // Find remainder\n    int r = N % 2;\n\n    // Condition for even\n    if (r == 0)  {\n        printf(\"Even\");\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise\n    else {\n        printf(\"Odd\");\n    }\n}\n```"}]
