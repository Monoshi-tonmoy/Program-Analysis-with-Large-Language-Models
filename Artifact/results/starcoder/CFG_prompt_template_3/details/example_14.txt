You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.<|end|>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}

Here is the breakdown of the control flow in the given Java program:

- The program begins by declaring two variables, `x` and `y`, and assigning them initial values of 15 and 25, respectively.

- It then calculates the maximum of the two numbers using the ternary operator (`x > y? x : y`).

- The program then enters a while loop, where it checks if the maximum value is divisible by both `x` and `y`. This is done by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of the maximum value divided by `x` is equal to zero, and the remainder of the maximum value divided by `y` is also equal to zero.

- If both conditions are true, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y` and breaks out of the while loop.

- If the maximum value is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments the maximum value by 1 and repeats the check until the maximum value is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

Here is the breakdown of the control flow in the given C program:

- The program includes the necessary header file `stdio.h` to use the `printf()` function.

- The main function begins by declaring two variables `x` and `y`, and assigning them initial values of 15 and 25, respectively.

- It then calculates the maximum of the two numbers using the greater than (`>`) operator, and the ternary operator (`?`), which returns `x` if `x` is greater than `y`, and returns `y` if `x` is not greater than `y`.

- The program then enters a while loop, where it checks if the maximum value is divisible by both `x` and `y`. This is done by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of the maximum value divided by `x` is equal to zero, and the remainder of the maximum value divided by `y` is also equal to zero.

- If both conditions are true, the program uses the `printf()` function to print the LCM of `x` and `y`, and then breaks out of the while loop using the `break` statement.

- If the maximum value is not divisible by both `x` and
