You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.<|end|>
<|user|>
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}

Here is the breakdown of the control flow in the given Java program:

- The program takes in an array of integers as input and calculates the average of the array.
- The main method contains the following steps:
1. Reads in the array from the user
2. Calculates the sum of all elements in the array
3. Divides the sum by the number of elements in the array to get the average
4. Prints the average

- The average method contains the following steps:
1. Calculates the sum of all elements in the input array
2. Divides the sum by the number of elements in the array to get the average
3. Returns the average

- The sum method contains the following steps:
1. Iterates over the input array and adds up all elements
2. Returns the sum

- The readArray method contains the following steps:
1. Creates a new array of the given size
2. Loops for each index in the array, prompting the user to enter a value at each index
3. Once all values have been entered, the method returns the array

- The loop in the readArray method is a for loop that continues until the user enters a negative value, indicating the end of the input.

- The if statement in the readArray method checks if the input value is negative, indicating the end of the input. If so, the method breaks out of the loop and returns the array.

- The main method calls the readArray method to get an input array from the user.

- The loop in the average method is a for loop that iterates over each element in the input array.

- The if statement in the average method checks if the current index is less than the length of the input array, indicating that we have reached the end of the array. If so, the method returns the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.

- The return statement in the average method returns the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.

- The loop in the sum method is a for loop that iterates over each element in the input array.

- The addition operator in the sum method adds up all elements in the input array.

- The return statement in the sum method returns the sum of all elements in the input array.

- The loop in the printArray method is a for
