You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.<|end|>
<|user|>
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```<|end|>

Here is the control flow information for the given program:

```
1. Program starts at the top and proceeds to the first line of code.
2. The first line of code is a preprocessor directive that includes the necessary header file for input/output operations.
3. The next line of code is a function definition for the main function.
4. The program then moves to the first statement of the main function, which is a call to the printf function.
5. The printf function displays the string "Enter an integer: " to the console.
6. The program then moves to the next line of code, which is a call to the scanf function.
7. The scanf function prompts the user to enter an integer and stores the input in the variable number.
8. The program then moves to the next line of code, which is a call to the printf function.
9. The printf function displays the string "You entered: " followed by the value of the variable number.
10. The program then moves to the next line of code, which is a return statement that returns a value of 0 to the operating system.
11. The program then exits the main function and terminates.
```

In this example, the program consists of three main components: the preprocessor directives, the function definition, and the function body. The preprocessor directives include the necessary header file for input/output operations, which is required for the program to run. The function definition specifies the main function, which is the entry point of the program. The function body contains the statements that make up the program's logic, including calls to the printf and scanf functions for input/output operations and a return statement that terminates the program.

The control flow of the program can be divided into three main stages: the input stage, the processing stage, and the output stage. In the input stage, the program prompts the user to enter an integer and stores the input in a variable. In the processing stage, the program performs the necessary calculations based on the input data and stores the result in another variable. In the output stage, the program displays the result to the user.

The program contains two decision points: the conditional statement in the scanf function and the conditional statement in the printf function. The conditional statement in the scanf function checks whether the user has entered a valid input. If the input is not valid, the program prompts the user to
