You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.<|end|>
<|user|>
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;

Here is the control flow information of the given C program:

- The program starts at the main function and executes the first line of code, which is a comment.
- The next line includes the necessary headers for the program to compile and run correctly.
- The function findRoots is defined, and the program moves to the first line of code in the function.
- The function takes three arguments: a, b, and c.
- The program moves to the next line of code, which is a comment.
- The function finds the discriminant, d, using the formula d = b^2 - 4ac.
- The program moves to the next line of code, which is a conditional statement.
- The program checks if the value of a is equal to 0. If it is, the program displays an error message and returns from the function.
- The program moves to the next line of code, which is another conditional statement.
- The program checks if the value of the discriminant, d, is greater than or equal to zero. If it is, the program moves to the next line of code.
- The program displays a message indicating that the roots are real and different.
- The program calculates the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant, using the square root function from the math library.
- The program moves to the next line of code, which is another conditional statement.
- The program checks if the value of the discriminant, d, is equal to zero. If it is, the program displays a message indicating that the roots are real and same.
- The program calculates the negative value of the b value divided by the value of a, multiplied by two, to find one of the roots.
- The program moves to the next line of code, which is another conditional statement.
- The program checks if the value of the discriminant, d, is less than zero. If it is, the program moves to the next line of code.
- The program displays a message indicating that the roots are complex.
- The program calculates the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant, using the square root function from the math library.
- The program calculates the negative value of the b value divided by the value of a, multiplied by two, to find one of the roots.
- The program calculates the imaginary part of the other root by
