Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char hostname[MAX_LEN];

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET);
            strcpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name);
            logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
}

Yes, there are several potential issues with the above pointer use:

1. The `clienthp` pointer is not properly initialized before being used, which can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
2. The `clienthp` pointer is not freed after being used, which can lead to memory leaks and resource waste.
3. The `hostname` pointer is not properly initialized before being used, which can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
4. The `hostname` pointer is not freed after being used, which can lead to memory leaks and resource waste.
5. The `clientaddr` pointer is not properly initialized before being used, which can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
6. The `clientaddr` pointer is not freed after being used, which can lead to memory leaks and resource waste.
7. The `serversocket` pointer is not freed after being used, which can lead to memory leaks and resource waste.

To address these issues, you can modify the code as follows:

```c
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define MAX_LEN 1024
#define MAX_CONNECTIONS 5

int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char *hostname = malloc(MAX_LEN * sizeof(char));

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET);
            strcpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name);
            logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    free(hostname);
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
