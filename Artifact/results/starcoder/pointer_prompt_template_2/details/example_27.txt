Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;)
    if (**ap!= '\0')
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;

free(ap[4]);
```<|end|>

Yes, there are several potential issues with the above pointer use:

1. Buffer overflow: The `strsep` function is not null-terminated, so it is possible for the `inputstring` pointer to overrun the buffer `argv` and write beyond the end of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

2. Use-after-free: The call to `free` on `ap[4]` could potentially free memory that is still in use, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

3. Memory leak: The call to `free` on `ap[4]` does not account for the possibility that `ap[4]` may be null, which can lead to a memory leak.

4. Memory corruption: The pointer `ap` is incremented after the call to `strsep`, which can lead to a pointer invalidation and potential memory corruption.

To address these issues, the code could be rewritten as follows:

1. Use a null-terminated array instead of a fixed-size array to prevent buffer overflow:
```c
char *argv[10];
char *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (inputstring = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;) {
    if (*inputstring!= '\0') {
        argv[ap - argv] = inputstring;
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;
    }
}
```

2. Use a separate loop to check for use-after-free:
```c
char **ap, *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (inputstring = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;) {
    if (*inputstring!= '\0') {
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;
    }
    free(inputstring);
}
```

3. Use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to ensure that all elements of the array are freed:
```c
char **ap, *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (inputstring = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;) {
    if (*inputstring!= '\0') {
        argv[ap - argv] = inputstring;
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;
    }
}

while (ap > argv)
    free(*
