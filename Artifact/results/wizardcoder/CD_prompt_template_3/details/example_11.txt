You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency because it imports itself in the main function. This means that the program is dependent on itself and cannot be executed without running into an infinite loop. 

To fix this cyclic dependency, we need to break the circular dependency by removing the self-import. We can do this by moving the main function to a separate file and importing it in the other files. 

Here's the updated code:

```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to perform addition
double add(double a, double b)
{
	return a + b;
}

// Function to perform subtraction
double subtract(double a, double b)
{
	return a - b;
}

// Function to perform multiplication
double multiply(double a, double b)
{
	return a * b;
}

// Function to perform division
double divide(double a, double b)
{
	return a / b;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, add(a, b));
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, subtract(a, b));
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, multiply(a, b));
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
