You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The given code is a simple program that checks whether a number is even or odd. The `checkEvenOdd()` function takes an integer `N` as input and checks if it is even or odd. 

The program has no cyclic dependencies as it does not have any modules or functions that depend on each other. However, if there were modules or functions that depend on each other, then the cyclic dependency analysis would be necessary to identify how they are interconnected in a cyclic manner.<|endoftext|>
