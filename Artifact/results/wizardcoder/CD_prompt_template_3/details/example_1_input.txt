Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.\n-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.\n\n-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B, sum = 0;\n\n    // Ask user to enter the two numbers\n    printf(\"Enter two numbers A and B : \\n\");\n\n    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &A, &B);\n\n    // Calculate the addition of A and B\n    // using '+' operator\n    sum = A + B;\n\n    // Print the sum\n    printf(\"Sum of A and B is: %d\", sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```"}]
