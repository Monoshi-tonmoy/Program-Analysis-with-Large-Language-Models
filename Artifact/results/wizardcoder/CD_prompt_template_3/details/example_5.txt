You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the `main` function and the `arr2` array. The `arr2` array is initialized with the address of elements in the `arr1` array. This creates a cyclic dependency between the two arrays, which means that the values in `arr2` are dependent on the values in `arr1`. This cyclic dependency can cause a program to run into an infinite loop or crash due to an infinite loop.

To remove the cyclic dependency, we can use a pointer to a pointer instead of an array of pointers. This way, we can avoid the cyclic dependency and ensure that the program runs without any issues.

Here's the updated code:

```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int** arr2 = (int**)malloc(5 * sizeof(int*));

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        arr2[i] = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // Freeing the dynamically allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        free(arr2[i]);
    }
    free(arr2);

    return 0;
}
```
