You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the `factorial()` function and the `main()` function. The `factorial()` function calls itself recursively to calculate the factorial of a given number. This creates a cycle in the program, where the `factorial()` function is called repeatedly until it reaches a base case. 

The `main()` function is dependent on the `factorial()` function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Therefore, the `main()` function is dependent on the `factorial()` function. 

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis details for the given program are:

- The `factorial()` function is dependent on the `main()` function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
