You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program is a simple program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle. However, it has a cyclic dependency as it imports the `stdio.h` header file which itself imports the `main()` function from the same file. This creates a cycle in the program, where the `main()` function is dependent on the `stdio.h` header file, which in turn is dependent on the `main()` function. 

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis details for this program are:

- The `stdio.h` header file imports the `main()` function from the same file.
- The `main()` function is dependent on the `stdio.h` header file, which in turn is dependent on the `main()` function.

Therefore, the cyclic dependency exists between the `stdio.h` header file and the `main()` function, which creates a cycle in the program.<|endoftext|>
