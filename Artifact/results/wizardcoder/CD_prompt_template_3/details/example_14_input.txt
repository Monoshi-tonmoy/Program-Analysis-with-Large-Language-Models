Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to find LCM of \n// two numbers \n#include <stdio.h> \n\n// Driver code \nint main() \n{ \n\tint x = 15, y = 25, max; \n\tmax = (x > y) ? x : y; \n\n\t// While loop to check if max variable \n\t// is divisible by x and y \n\twhile (1) { \n\t\tif (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { \n\t\t\tprintf(\"The LCM of %d and %d is %d.\", x, y, \n\t\t\t\tmax); \n\t\t\tbreak; \n\t\t} \n\n\t\t++max; \n\t} \n\n\treturn 0; \n}\n```"}]
