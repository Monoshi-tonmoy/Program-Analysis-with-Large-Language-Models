You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the `interchangeFirstLast()` function and the `main()` function. The `interchangeFirstLast()` function swaps the element of the first and last row of the matrix, and the `main()` function calls this function. This creates a cyclic dependency between the two functions. 

To analyze the cyclic dependency, we need to understand how the functions are interconnected. The `main()` function calls the `interchangeFirstLast()` function, which in turn swaps the element of the first and last row of the matrix. This creates a cyclic dependency between the two functions. 

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis details for the given program are:

- The `interchangeFirstLast()` function swaps the element of the first and last row of the matrix.
- The `main()` function calls the `interchangeFirstLast()` function.
- The `main()` function and the `interchangeFirstLast()` function are interconnected in a cyclic manner.<|endoftext|>
