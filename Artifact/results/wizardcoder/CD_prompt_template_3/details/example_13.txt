You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the `fib()` and `printFib()` functions. The `fib()` function is called by `printFib()` function and vice versa. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will not execute correctly. 

To analyze the cyclic dependency, we need to understand the flow of the program. The `printFib()` function is called by the `main()` function. The `fib()` function is called by the `printFib()` function. The `fib()` function is called recursively until it reaches the base case of `n < 3`. 

The `fib()` function updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` variables and then calls itself with `n-1` as the argument. This recursive call continues until the base case is reached. 

The `printFib()` function handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and then calls the `fib()` function with `n` as the argument. The `fib()` function updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` variables and then calls itself with `n-1` as the argument. This recursive call continues until the base case is reached. 

The cyclic dependency exists between the `fib()` and `printFib()` functions because the `fib()` function is called by the `printFib()` function and vice versa. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will not execute correctly. 

To fix the cyclic dependency, we can remove the cyclic dependency by moving the `fib()` function to a separate module and importing it in both the `printFib()` and `main()` functions. This will remove the cyclic dependency and make the program work correctly.<|endoftext|>
