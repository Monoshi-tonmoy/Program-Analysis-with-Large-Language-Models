You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program declares two integer variables `x` and `y` and assigns them values `15` and `25` respectively.

2. The program then calculates the maximum value between `x` and `y` and assigns it to the `max` variable.

3. The program enters a `while` loop to check if the `max` variable is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

4. If the `max` variable is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y` and exits the loop.

5. If the `max` variable is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments the `max` variable and continues the loop.

6. The program then exits the `while` loop and returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
