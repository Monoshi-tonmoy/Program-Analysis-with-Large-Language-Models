You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. The program declares two integer variables `l` and `b` and assigns them values `10`.
3. The program prints the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and printing the result using the `printf()` function.
4. The program prints the perimeter of the rectangle by adding `l` and `b` and multiplying the result by `2` and printing the result using the `printf()` function.
5. The program returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
