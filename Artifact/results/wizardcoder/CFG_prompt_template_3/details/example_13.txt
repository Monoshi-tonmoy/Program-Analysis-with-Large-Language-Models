You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `prev1` and `prev2` with values `1` and `0` respectively. These variables are used to store the previous two terms of the Fibonacci series.

2. The program then defines a recursive function `fib` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns nothing. This function calculates the `n`th term of the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two terms. It then updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` to store the previous two terms.

3. The program then defines a function `printFib` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns nothing. This function handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and calls the `fib` function to calculate the remaining terms.

4. The `main` function calls the `printFib` function with an argument of `9` and prints the first `9` terms of the Fibonacci series.

The decision points and loops in the control flow of the program are:

1. The program starts by checking if the number of terms is less than `1`. If it is, the program prints an error message and exits.

2. The program then checks if the number of terms is `1`. If it is, the program prints the first term of the Fibonacci series.

3. The program then checks if the number of terms is `2`. If it is, the program prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series.

4. The program then checks if the number of terms is greater than `2`. If it is, the program prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and calls the `fib` function to calculate the remaining terms.

5. The `fib` function is a recursive function that calculates the `n`th term of the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two terms. It then updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` to store the previous two terms.

6. The `printFib` function is a non-recursive function that handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and calls the `fib` function to calculate the remaining terms.

7. The `main` function is the driver code that calls the `printFib` function with an argument of `9` and prints the first `9` terms of the Fib
