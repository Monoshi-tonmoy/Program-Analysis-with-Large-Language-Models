You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. In the `main()` function, the value of `num` is assigned to 5.
3. The `factorial()` function is called with `num` as the argument.
4. In the `factorial()` function, a variable `result` is initialized to 1.
5. A `for` loop is used to iterate from 2 to `n` (where `n` is the argument passed to the function).
6. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `result` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.
7. After the loop completes, the value of `result` is returned.
8. The `main()` function prints the value of `result` using `printf()`.
9. The program terminates and returns 0.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
