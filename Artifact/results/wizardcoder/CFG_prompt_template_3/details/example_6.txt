You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing at the `main()` function.
2. In the `main()` function, a variable `f` is assigned the value of 40.
3. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function is called with the parameter `f`.
4. In the `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function, the formula `(f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0` is used to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
5. The result of the conversion is stored in a variable `c`.
6. The result `c` is printed to the console using the `printf()` function.
7. The program exits and returns 0.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
