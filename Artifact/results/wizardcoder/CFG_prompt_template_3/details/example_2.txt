You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring a function `checkEvenOdd` which takes an integer `N` as input.
2. The function finds the remainder of `N` when divided by 2.
3. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even".
4. Otherwise, the function prints "Odd".

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
