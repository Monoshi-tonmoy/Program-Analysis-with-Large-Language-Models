You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing at the `main()` function.
2. The program prompts the user to enter an integer using the `printf()` function.
3. The user enters an integer and presses the Enter key.
4. The program reads the input using the `scanf()` function and stores it in the `number` variable.
5. The program displays the input using the `printf()` function.
6. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
