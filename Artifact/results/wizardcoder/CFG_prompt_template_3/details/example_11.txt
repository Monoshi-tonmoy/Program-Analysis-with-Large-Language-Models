You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is a while loop that runs indefinitely. Inside the loop, there is a switch statement that is used to differentiate between different operators (+, -, *, /). The program prompts the user to enter an operator and two operands. Based on the operator entered, the program performs the corresponding operation and displays the result. If the user enters an invalid operator, the program displays an error message. The program then prompts the user to enter another operator and operands. The loop continues until the user enters 'x' to exit.<|endoftext|>
