You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `i`.
2. The program then prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from A-Z.
3. The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of A-Z.
4. Inside the loop, the program converts the integer value of `i` to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and prints it.
5. After the loop completes, the program prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from a-z.
6. The program then uses another `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of a-z.
7. Inside the loop, the program converts the integer value of `i` to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and prints it.
8. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
