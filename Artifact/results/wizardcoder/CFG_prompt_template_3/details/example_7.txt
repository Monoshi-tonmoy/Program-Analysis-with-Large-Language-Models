You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. The program assigns values to the variables `P`, `R`, and `T`.
3. The program calculates the simple interest using the formula `(P * T * R) / 100`.
4. The program prints the calculated simple interest using the `printf()` function.
5. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
