You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring a function `print_table` which takes two integer arguments `range` and `num`.
2. The function then initializes a variable `mul` to store the product of `num` and `i`.
3. The function then enters a `for` loop which iterates from 1 to `range`.
4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the product of `num` and `i` and stores it in the variable `mul`.
5. The function then prints the multiplication table using `printf()` function.
6. Finally, the function returns from the loop and the program continues with the `main()` function.
7. In the `main()` function, the program initializes two integer variables `range` and `num` with values 10 and 5 respectively.
8. The program then calls the `print_table()` function with the given arguments.
9. The `print_table()` function then calculates the multiplication table of `num` and prints it using `printf()` function.
10. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in the given program.<|endoftext|>
