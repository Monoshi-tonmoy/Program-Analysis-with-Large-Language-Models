You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header file `stdio.h` which contains standard input/output functions.

2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. Inside the `main()` function, three variables are declared: `A`, `B`, and `sum`. `A` and `B` are integers, and `sum` is an integer variable that will hold the sum of `A` and `B`.

4. The program then prompts the user to enter two numbers `A` and `B` using the `printf()` function.

5. The user enters the two numbers `2` and `3` and presses `Enter`.

6. The `scanf()` function reads the two numbers `2` and `3` from the user and stores them in the variables `A` and `B`.

7. The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator and stores the result in the variable `sum`.

8. Finally, the program prints the sum using the `printf()` function.

9. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.<|endoftext|>
