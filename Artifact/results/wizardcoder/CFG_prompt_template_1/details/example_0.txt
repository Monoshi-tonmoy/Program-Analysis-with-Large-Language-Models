You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header file `stdio.h` which contains standard input/output functions.

2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. Inside the `main()` function, the program declares an integer variable `number` to store the input value.

4. The program then prompts the user to enter an integer using the `printf()` function.

5. The `scanf()` function is used to read the input value from the user and store it in the `number` variable.

6. Finally, the program displays the input value using the `printf()` function.

7. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.<|endoftext|>
