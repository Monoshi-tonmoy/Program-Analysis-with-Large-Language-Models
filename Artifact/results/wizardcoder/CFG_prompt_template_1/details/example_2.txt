You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header file `stdio.h`.
2. The program defines a function `checkEvenOdd` which takes an integer `N` as input.
3. The function finds the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator `%`.
4. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even" to the console.
5. Otherwise, the function prints "Odd" to the console.
6. The program ends.<|endoftext|>
