You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The main function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
3. Three variables are declared: P, R, and T, which represent the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period, respectively.
4. The formula for calculating simple interest is calculated using the given values of P, R, and T.
5. The calculated value of simple interest is stored in the variable SI.
6. The value of SI is printed to the console using the printf() function.
7. The program ends by returning 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
