You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files and defining the size of the matrix as 3x3.
2. The program then defines a function `interchangeFirstLast` which takes a 2D matrix as input and swaps the element of the first and last row across the rows.
3. The `interchangeFirstLast` function uses a nested for loop to iterate through each element of the matrix and swap it with the corresponding element of the last row.
4. The `main` function then initializes a 2D matrix with some values and prints it.
5. The `main` function then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function to swap the element of the first and last row across the rows.
6. Finally, the `main` function prints the original matrix and the output matrix after the element swap.<|endoftext|>
