You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

- The program starts by including the necessary header files and declaring the necessary variables.
- The `main()` function is defined which is the entry point of the program.
- Inside the `main()` function, two loops are defined. The first loop is used to print the alphabets from (A-Z) and the second loop is used to print the alphabets from (a-z).
- The first loop starts with the ASCII value of A (65) and ends with the ASCII value of Z (90). The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- Inside the loop, the ASCII value of `i` is converted to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and then printed using the `cout` statement.
- The second loop starts with the ASCII value of a (97) and ends with the ASCII value of z (122). The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- Inside the loop, the ASCII value of `i` is converted to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and then printed using the `cout` statement.
- Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
