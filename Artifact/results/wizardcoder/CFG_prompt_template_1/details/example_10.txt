You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
```
Program Control Flow:

The program starts by including the necessary header file "stdio.h" which contains the standard input/output functions.

Then, the program defines a function "factorial" which takes an unsigned integer "n" as input and returns the factorial of "n".

The function starts by initializing a variable "result" to 1 and a loop variable "i" to 2.

The loop runs from 2 to "n" and multiplies "result" by "i" in each iteration.

Finally, the function returns the value of "result".

The program then calls the "factorial" function with an input value of 5 and prints the result using the "printf" function.

The program ends with a return statement which returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
