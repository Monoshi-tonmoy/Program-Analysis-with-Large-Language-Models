You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `x` and `y` and assigning them values `15` and `25` respectively.

2. The program then declares a variable `max` and assigns it the value of the greater of the two variables `x` and `y`.

3. The program then enters a `while` loop to check if the value of `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

4. If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y` and breaks out of the loop.

5. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments the value of `max` by `1` and continues the loop.

6. Once the loop is complete, the program returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

- The program takes two integer inputs `x` and `y`.
- The program calculates the maximum value between `x` and `y` and assigns it to the variable `max`.
- The program checks if the value of `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.
- If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y`.
- If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments the value of `max` by `1` and continues the loop.
- Once the loop is complete, the program returns `0` to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
