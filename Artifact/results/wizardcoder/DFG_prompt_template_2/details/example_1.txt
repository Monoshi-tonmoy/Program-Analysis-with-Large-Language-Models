You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files such as `stdio.h` which provides input/output functions.

2. The `main()` function is the starting point of the program.

3. Inside the `main()` function, three variables are declared: `A`, `B`, and `sum`.

4. The program then asks the user to enter two numbers `A` and `B` using the `printf()` function.

5. The user inputs the two numbers using the `scanf()` function and stores them in the variables `A` and `B`.

6. The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator and stores the result in the variable `sum`.

7. Finally, the program prints the sum using the `printf()` function.

8. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

- The program reads two numbers from the user and stores them in the variables `A` and `B`.
- The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` and stores the result in the variable `sum`.
- The program prints the sum to the user.<|endoftext|>
