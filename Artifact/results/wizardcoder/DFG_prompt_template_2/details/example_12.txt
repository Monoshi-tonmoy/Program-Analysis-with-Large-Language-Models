You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.

2. The program defines a function `print_table` which takes two integer arguments `range` and `num`.

3. Inside the `print_table` function, a variable `mul` is declared to store the product of `num` and `i`.

4. The `for` loop is used to calculate the multiplication table of `num` from 1 to `range`.

5. The product of `num` and `i` is stored in the `mul` variable.

6. The `printf` function is used to print the multiplication table.

7. The `return` statement is used to end the program.

8. The `main` function is called to execute the program.

9. The `range` and `num` variables are initialized with the values 10 and 5 respectively.

10. The `print_table` function is called with the `range` and `num` variables as arguments.

11. The program ends with a `return` statement.<|endoftext|>
