You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `number`.
2. The program then prompts the user to enter an integer using the `printf()` function.
3. The user enters an integer and the program reads it using the `scanf()` function and stores it in the `number` variable.
4. Finally, the program displays the input using the `printf()` function.

Therefore, the dataflow in the program is from the user input to the output.<|endoftext|>
