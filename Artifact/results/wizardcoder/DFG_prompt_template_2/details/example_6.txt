You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.

2. The program defines a function `fahrenheit_to_celsius` which takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius.

3. The program then defines a `main` function which initializes a variable `f` with a value of 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

4. The program then calls the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function with the value of `f` as input and stores the result in a variable `c`.

5. Finally, the program prints the temperature in Celsius using the `printf` function.
