You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `prev1` and `prev2` with values `1` and `0` respectively. These variables are used to store the previous two terms of the Fibonacci series.

2. The program then defines a recursive function `fib` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns nothing. This function prints the Fibonacci series up to the `n`th term.

3. The `fib` function first checks if `n` is less than `3`. If it is, the function returns without doing anything.

4. If `n` is greater than or equal to `3`, the function calculates the `n`th term of the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two terms `prev1` and `prev2`. It then updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` to be the previous two terms of the series.

5. The `fib` function then calls itself recursively with the argument `n-1`. This continues until `n` is less than `3`.

6. The program then defines a function `printFib` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns nothing. This function handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and calls the `fib` function to print the rest of the series.

7. The `printFib` function first checks if `n` is less than `1`. If it is, the function prints an error message and returns.

8. If `n` is `1`, the function prints the first term of the Fibonacci series, which is `0`.

9. If `n` is `2`, the function prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, which are `0` and `1`.

10. If `n` is greater than `2`, the function prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, which are `0` and `1`. It then calls the `fib` function to print the rest of the series.

11. Finally, the program calls the `printFib` function with an argument of `9` and returns `0` to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
