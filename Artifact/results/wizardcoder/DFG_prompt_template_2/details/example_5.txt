You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program then defines a function `main()` which is the entry point of the program.
3. Inside the `main()` function, an integer array `arr1` is declared with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4. The program then initializes the elements of the array with values.
5. Next, an integer pointer array `arr2` is declared with 5 rows and 5 columns.
6. The program then uses a nested for loop to initialize each element of the pointer array with the address of the corresponding element in the other array.
7. Finally, the program uses another nested for loop to print the values of the array using the array of pointers.

The dataflow of the program is that the values of the array `arr1` are first initialized and stored in the array `arr2`. Then, the values of the array `arr2` are printed using the array of pointers.<|endoftext|>
