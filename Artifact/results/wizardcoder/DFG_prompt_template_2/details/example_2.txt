You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program takes an integer input from the user.
2. The input is then passed to the `checkEvenOdd()` function.
3. The `checkEvenOdd()` function calculates the remainder of the input number when divided by 2.
4. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even". Otherwise, it prints "Odd".

Therefore, the dataflow in the program is as follows:

- Input: The program takes an integer input from the user.
- Data: The input is an integer.
- Process: The program checks if the input is even or odd.
- Output: The program outputs "Even" or "Odd" based on the input.<|endoftext|>
