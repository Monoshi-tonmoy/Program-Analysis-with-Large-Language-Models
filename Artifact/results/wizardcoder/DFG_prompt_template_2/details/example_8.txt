You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `l` and `b` with values 10.

2. The `printf()` function is used to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The area is calculated by multiplying `l` and `b`, and the perimeter is calculated by adding `l` and `b` and multiplying the result by 2.

3. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

- The program takes input from the user for the length and breadth of the rectangle.
- The program calculates the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the given formula.
- The program displays the area and perimeter of the rectangle to the user.<|endoftext|>
