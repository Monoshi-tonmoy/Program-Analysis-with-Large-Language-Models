You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring the necessary variables: `ch`, `a`, and `b`.
2. The program then enters a while loop to keep asking the user for input until they choose to exit.
3. Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to enter an operator and two operands.
4. The program then uses a switch case statement to differentiate between different operators.
5. If the user enters an addition operator, the program will add the two operands and display the result.
6. If the user enters a subtraction operator, the program will subtract the two operands and display the result.
7. If the user enters a multiplication operator, the program will multiply the two operands and display the result.
8. If the user enters a division operator, the program will divide the two operands and display the result.
9. If the user enters an invalid operator, the program will display an error message.
10. Finally, the program will display a new line for the next iteration of the loop.

Overall, the program is a simple calculator that uses a switch case statement to differentiate between different operators. The dataflow of the program is simple and easy to understand.<|endoftext|>
