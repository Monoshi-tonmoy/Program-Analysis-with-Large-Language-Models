You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
```
Data Flow:

1. The program takes an integer input from the user.
2. The program calls the factorial function with the input number as an argument.
3. The factorial function takes the input number as an argument and returns the factorial of the number.
4. The factorial function initializes a variable result to 1 and a loop variable i to 2.
5. The loop runs from 2 to the input number and multiplies the result variable with i in each iteration.
6. After the loop completes, the function returns the result variable as the factorial of the input number.
7. The main function calls the factorial function with the input number and prints the result.
8. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
