You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program defines a function `print_table` which takes two integer arguments `range` and `num`.
3. Inside the function, a variable `mul` is declared to store the product of `num` and `i`.
4. The function then uses a for loop to calculate the multiplication table of `num` from 1 to `range`.
5. For each iteration of the loop, the product of `num` and `i` is calculated and stored in the variable `mul`.
6. The function then prints the multiplication table using the `printf` function.
7. Finally, the `main` function is called which initializes the `range` and `num` variables and calls the `print_table` function.

The output of the program will be:

```
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
