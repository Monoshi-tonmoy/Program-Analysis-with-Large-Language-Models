You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program declares an integer variable `i`.
3. The program prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from A-Z.
4. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of A-Z.
5. Inside the loop, the program converts the integer value of `i` to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator.
6. The program prints the character value of `i` using `cout`.
7. The program prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from a-z.
8. The program uses another `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of a-z.
9. Inside the loop, the program converts the integer value of `i` to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator.
10. The program prints the character value of `i` using `cout`.
11. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.<|endoftext|>
