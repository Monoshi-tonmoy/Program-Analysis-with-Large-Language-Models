You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program defines the main function.
3. The program initializes the variables P, R, and T with the given values.
4. The program calculates the simple interest SI using the formula (P * T * R) / 100.
5. The program prints the value of SI using the printf() function.
6. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
