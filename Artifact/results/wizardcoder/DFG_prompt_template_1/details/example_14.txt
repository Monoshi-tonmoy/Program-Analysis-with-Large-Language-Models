You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
```
// Dataflow information of the program:

// 1. The program takes two integer inputs x and y.
// 2. The program initializes a variable max with the maximum value of x and y.
// 3. The program enters a while loop to check if max is divisible by x and y.
// 4. If max is divisible by x and y, the program prints the LCM of x and y.
// 5. If max is not divisible by x and y, the program increments max by 1 and continues the loop.
// 6. The program exits the while loop and returns 0.<|endoftext|>
