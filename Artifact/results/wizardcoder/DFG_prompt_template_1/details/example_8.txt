You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header file `stdio.h` which contains the standard input/output functions.

2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. Inside the `main()` function, two integer variables `l` and `b` are declared and initialized to 10.

4. The `printf()` function is used to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The `%d` format specifier is used to print integers.

5. The `return 0;` statement is used to indicate the successful termination of the program.<|endoftext|>
