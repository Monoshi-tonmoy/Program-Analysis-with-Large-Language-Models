You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program declares two integer variables `x` and `y` and assigns them values `15` and `25` respectively.

2. The program then declares a variable `max` and assigns it the value of `x` if `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise it assigns it the value of `y`.

3. The program then enters a while loop to check if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

4. If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y` and breaks out of the loop.

5. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by `1` and continues the loop.

6. The program then returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

- The program declares two integer variables `x` and `y` and assigns them values `15` and `25` respectively.
- The program then declares a variable `max` and assigns it the value of `x` if `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise it assigns it the value of `y`.
- The program then enters a while loop to check if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.
- If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints the LCM of `x` and `y` and breaks out of the loop.
- If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by `1` and continues the loop.
- The program then returns `0` to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
