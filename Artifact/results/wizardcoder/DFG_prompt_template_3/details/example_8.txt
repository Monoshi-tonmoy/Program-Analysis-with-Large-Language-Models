You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program is a simple program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program declares two integer variables `l` and `b` to store the length and breadth of the rectangle, respectively. The program then prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the `printf()` function.

The dataflow in this program is as follows:

1. The program declares two integer variables `l` and `b` to store the length and breadth of the rectangle, respectively.

2. The program then calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b`.

3. The program then calculates the perimeter of the rectangle by adding `l` and `b` and multiplying the result by 2.

4. The program prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the `printf()` function.

Therefore, the dataflow in this program is as follows:

- The program takes input from the user for the length and breadth of the rectangle.

- The program calculates the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the given formulas.

- The program then prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle to the console.<|endoftext|>
