You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program takes an integer input from the user.
2. The `factorial()` function takes an integer input `n` and returns the factorial of `n`.
3. The `factorial()` function initializes a variable `result` to 1 and loops from 2 to `n` to get the factorial.
4. In each iteration of the loop, the `result` variable is multiplied by the current value of `i`.
5. After the loop, the `result` variable contains the factorial of `n`.
6. The `main()` function calls the `factorial()` function with the input integer `num` and prints the result.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

```
Input -> factorial() -> Output
```

The `factorial()` function takes an integer input `n` and returns the factorial of `n`. The `main()` function takes an integer input from the user and calls the `factorial()` function to get the factorial of the input integer.<|endoftext|>
