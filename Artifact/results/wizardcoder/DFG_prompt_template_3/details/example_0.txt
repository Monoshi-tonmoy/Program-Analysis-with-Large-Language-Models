You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. The user enters an integer and the program reads it using the `scanf()` function.
3. The program then displays the entered integer using the `printf()` function.

Therefore, the dataflow is from the user input to the output.<|endoftext|>
