You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers A and B.
2. The user enters two numbers A and B.
3. The program reads the two numbers A and B from the user using the scanf() function.
4. The program calculates the sum of A and B using the '+' operator.
5. The program prints the sum of A and B using the printf() function.

Therefore, the dataflow in the given program is as follows:

```
User input -> main() -> A, B, sum = A + B -> printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum)
