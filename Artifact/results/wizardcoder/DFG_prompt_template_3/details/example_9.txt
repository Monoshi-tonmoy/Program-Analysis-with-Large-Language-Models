You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program declares an integer variable `i`.
2. The program prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from A-Z.
3. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of A-Z (65-90).
4. Inside the loop, the program uses the `(char)` operator to convert the integer value to its corresponding character value.
5. The program prints each character value on a new line.
6. The program prints a message asking the user to enter alphabets from a-z.
7. The program uses another `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII values of a-z (97-122).
8. Inside the loop, the program uses the `(char)` operator to convert the integer value to its corresponding character value.
9. The program prints each character value on a new line.
10. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

The program manipulates data by iterating through the ASCII values of A-Z and a-z and printing each character value on a new line. The data is not stored in any variable or data structure, but is instead manipulated directly by the program.<|endoftext|>
