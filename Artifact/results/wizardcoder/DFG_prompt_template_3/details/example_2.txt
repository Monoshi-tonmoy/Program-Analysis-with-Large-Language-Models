You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program takes an integer as input from the user.
2. The integer is then passed as an argument to the `checkEvenOdd()` function.
3. The `checkEvenOdd()` function calculates the remainder of the integer when divided by 2.
4. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even". Otherwise, it prints "Odd".

Therefore, the dataflow in the program is as follows:

```
User input -> checkEvenOdd() -> Remainder -> Output
