You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `prev1` and `prev2` with initial values 1 and 0 respectively. These variables will be used to store the previous two numbers in the Fibonacci series.

2. The program then defines a recursive function `fib` that takes an integer `n` as input. This function will calculate the `n`th number in the Fibonacci series and print it.

3. The `fib` function first checks if `n` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns without doing anything.

4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the `n`th number in the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two numbers (`prev1` and `prev2`) and storing the result in a variable `fn`.

5. The function then updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` to be the previous two numbers in the series.

6. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with `n-1` as the input until `n` is less than 3.

7. The program then defines a function `printFib` that takes an integer `n` as input. This function will handle the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and call the `fib` function to print the remaining terms.

8. The `printFib` function first checks if `n` is less than 1. If it is, the function prints an error message and returns.

9. If `n` is 1, the function prints 0.

10. If `n` is 2, the function prints 0 and 1.

11. If `n` is greater than 2, the function prints 0 and 1 and calls the `fib` function to print the remaining terms.

12. The program then calls the `printFib` function with an input of 9 to print the first 9 terms of the Fibonacci series.<|endoftext|>
