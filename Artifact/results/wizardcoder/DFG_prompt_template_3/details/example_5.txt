You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The dataflow in the given program is as follows:

1. The program declares two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`. `arr1` is an integer array of size 5x5, and `arr2` is a pointer array of size 5x5.

2. The program then initializes each element of the pointer array with the address of the corresponding element in the other array.

3. The program then prints the values of the array using the array of pointers.

4. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

The dataflow of the program is that the values of the array `arr1` are copied into the array `arr2` using the pointer array. The values of `arr2` are then printed, which are the same as the values of `arr1`.<|endoftext|>
