### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
    char *retMessage;
    char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));

    // copy input string to a temporary string
    char message[length+1];
    int index;
    for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        message[index] = strMessage[index];
    }
    message[index] = '\0';

    // trim trailing whitespace
    int len = index-1;
    while (isspace(message[len])) {
        message[len] = '\0';
        len--;
    }

    // return string without trailing whitespace
    retMessage = message;
    return retMessage;
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string without any trailing whitespace. The function first allocates memory for a new string using `malloc()` and copies the input string to the new string. It then trims any trailing whitespace by iterating backwards through the new string and removing any whitespace characters. Finally, it returns the new string without any trailing whitespace.

The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer, or pointer issues. However, it is worth noting that the function does not check for buffer overflows or other potential issues that could cause memory errors or security vulnerabilities.<|endoftext|>
