You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun9() {
    int *ptr;
    *ptr = 15;
    int temp = *ptr;
    free(ptr);
    return temp;
}
'''

### Response:
The code is attempting to dereference a null pointer and then free it. This is a classic example of a memory leak, where the memory allocated for the pointer is not properly deallocated. Additionally, the code is assigning a value to a pointer that was not allocated, which is a classic example of a buffer overflow. Finally, the code is not checking the return value of `free()` to see if it was successful, which could lead to a crash or other undefined behavior. Overall, the code is vulnerable to several memory-related issues and should be reviewed for security vulnerabilities.<|endoftext|>
