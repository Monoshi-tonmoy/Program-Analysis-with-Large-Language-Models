You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int foo(struc ptr*) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues. The `free()` function is used to deallocate memory allocated by `malloc()` or `calloc()`. The `ptr` parameter is a pointer to a structure that contains two members, `member` and `field`. The `free()` function is called twice on these members, which deallocate the memory they point to. Finally, the function returns 0 to indicate successful completion.<|endoftext|>
