### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code is allocating memory using `malloc()` and then freeing it in a loop. This is a common mistake that can lead to memory leaks and other issues. The `free()` function should be called only once, after all the memory has been used. In this case, the `free()` function should be called after the loop has finished executing. Additionally, the `malloc()` function should be called with the correct size of memory to be allocated. In this case, the `malloc()` function should be called with `sizeof(int)` to allocate memory for an integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```c
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

This code should work correctly and allocate memory for an integer and then free it after the loop has finished executing.<|endoftext|>
