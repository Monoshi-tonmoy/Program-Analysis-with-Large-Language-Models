You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun() {
    nresp = packet_get_int();
    if (nresp > 0) {
    response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
    for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
        response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
    }
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be a function that receives a packet from a network and stores the response in a dynamically allocated memory. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The function `packet_get_int()` is not defined anywhere in the code.
2. The function `packet_get_string()` is not defined anywhere in the code.
3. The `xmalloc()` function is not defined anywhere in the code.
4. The `response` variable is not initialized before it is used.
5. The `response` variable is not freed after it is used.

Therefore, it is not possible to analyze the code without further information.<|endoftext|>
