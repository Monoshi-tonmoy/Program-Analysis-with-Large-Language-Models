You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues. The code declares two integer variables `num` and `*intptr` which points to `num`. Then it declares a float pointer `floatptr` which points to the memory address of `num` using type casting.

The code then assigns the value `20.5` to the memory address pointed to by `floatptr`. Finally, it prints the value of `num` and the value at `floatptr`.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues.<|endoftext|>
