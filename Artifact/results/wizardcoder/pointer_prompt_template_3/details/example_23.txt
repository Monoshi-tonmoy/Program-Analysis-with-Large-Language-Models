You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int *p = x;
char * second_char = (char *)(p + 1);
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues. It declares a pointer `p` to an integer variable `x`, and then casts it to a `char` pointer to access the second character of the integer. This is a common operation in C and C++ programming, as pointers can be cast to different types. However, it is important to note that the pointer arithmetic used in this code is not portable and may not work correctly on all platforms.<|endoftext|>
