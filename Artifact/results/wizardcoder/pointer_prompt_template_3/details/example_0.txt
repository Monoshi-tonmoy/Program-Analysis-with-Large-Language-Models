### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun1() {
    int i;
    char arr1[2];
    char arr2[10];
    /*... */
    for (i = 0; i!= 10; ++i) {
        ((short*)arr1)[0] = arr2[i];
        arr1[1] = arr2[9-i];
    }
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues. The code initializes two arrays of char type, `arr1` and `arr2`, with sizes 2 and 10 respectively. It then uses a for loop to copy the values of `arr2` into `arr1` and `arr2` respectively. The `((short*)arr1)[0]` expression is used to cast `arr1` to a `short*` pointer and assign the value of `arr2[i]` to the first element of `arr1`. The `arr1[1]` expression is used to assign the value of `arr2[9-i]` to the second element of `arr1`. This effectively copies the values of `arr2` into `arr1` and `arr2` in reverse order. Finally, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues.<|endoftext|>
