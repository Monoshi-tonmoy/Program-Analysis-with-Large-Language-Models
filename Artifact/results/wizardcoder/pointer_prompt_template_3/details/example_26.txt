You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int foo(int SIZE) {
    char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
    if (err) {
        abrt = 1;
        free(ptr);
    }

    // Some code here

    if (abrt) {
        logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
    }
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `ptr` variable, which is then used to store the result of the `malloc` function. The `if` statement checks if an error has occurred, and if so, it sets the `abrt` variable to 1 and frees the memory allocated for `ptr`. The `if` statement is followed by some code that may or may not contain buffer or pointer issues. Finally, the `if` statement checks if `abrt` is set to 1, and if so, it logs an error message with the `ptr` variable.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and does not contain any memory, buffer or pointer issues.<|endoftext|>
