### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char hostname[MAX_LEN];

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET);
            strcpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name);
            logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
}

### Response:
The code seems to be a simple server program that accepts client connections and logs the hostname of the client. However, there are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed:

1. The `gethostbyaddr` function is used to get the hostname of the client, but it is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. It is recommended to use `gethostbyaddr_r` instead, which is a thread-safe version of `gethostbyaddr`.

2. The `strcpy` function is used to copy the hostname into a fixed-size buffer, but it is not guaranteed to null-terminate the string. It is recommended to use `strncpy` instead, which copies a specified number of characters from the source string into the destination string, including the null terminator.

3. The `logOutput` function is not defined anywhere in the code. It is recommended to define this function to log the hostname of the client to a file or console.

Here is the corrected code:

```
#include <netdb.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_LEN 256
#define MAX_CONNECTIONS 10

int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char hostname[MAX_LEN];

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr_r((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET, NULL, &h_errno, &h_errlist);
            if (clienthp == NULL) {
                logOutput("Error: gethostbyaddr_r failed with error code ", h_errno);
            } else {
                strncpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name, MAX_LEN);
                hostname[MAX_LEN-1] = '\0'; // null-terminate the string
                logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            }
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
