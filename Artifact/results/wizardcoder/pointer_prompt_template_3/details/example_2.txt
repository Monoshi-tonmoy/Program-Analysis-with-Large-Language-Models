You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

### Instruction:
The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun3() {
    int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int *ptr = arr;
    int value = *(ptr + 6);
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code seems to be accessing an element outside the bounds of the array. The array has 5 elements, but the pointer is being incremented by 6, which would result in accessing an element outside the bounds of the array. This is a buffer overrun issue, where the program reads or writes beyond the allocated memory space.

To fix this issue, the pointer should be incremented by a smaller value, such as 5, to ensure that it does not access an element outside the bounds of the array.<|endoftext|>
