### Instruction:
Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int bar() { int a = 12, b = 24; int *sum = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); *sum = a + b; printf("%d\n", *sum); printf("%d\n", *sum); return 0; }
'''

### Response:
The code snippet given by triple backticks is a function `bar()` that takes no arguments and returns an integer value. The function first declares two integer variables `a` and `b` and then dynamically allocates memory for an integer variable `sum` using the `malloc()` function. The function then assigns the sum of `a` and `b` to the `sum` variable and prints the value of `sum` twice.

The code snippet does not have any issues with bad pointer arithmetic, unsafe dereferencing, buffer overflow or buffer underwrite, bad allocation / deallocation, or improper sanitization of input.<|endoftext|>
