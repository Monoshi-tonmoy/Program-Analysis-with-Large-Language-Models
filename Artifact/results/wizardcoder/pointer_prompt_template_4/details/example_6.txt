### Instruction:
Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int fun7() {
    int* p;
    int n = *p1;
    printf("%d", n);
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code snippet given is a function `fun7()` that dereferences a null pointer `p1` and then prints the value of `n`. This is a common mistake that can lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior. The reason for this is that `p1` is a null pointer, which means that it does not point to any valid memory location. Therefore, dereferencing it will result in undefined behavior.

Additionally, the code snippet does not check if `p1` is null before dereferencing it, which can also lead to undefined behavior.

To fix this issue, the code should check if `p1` is null before dereferencing it. For example:

```
int fun7() {
    int* p = NULL;
    if (p1!= NULL) {
        int n = *p1;
        printf("%d", n);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code checks if `p1` is null before dereferencing it, and if it is not null, it dereferences it and prints the value of `n`.<|endoftext|>
