### Instruction:
Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
struct Ex {
    int field;
};

int fun5(struct Ex *d) {
    int val;
    if (d->field) 
        val = 1;

    if (d->field)
        val = 2;
    return 0;
}

### Response:
The code snippet given has a few issues:
- The code is not checking if `d` is null before dereferencing it.
- The code is not checking if `d->field` is null before dereferencing it.
- The code is not checking if `val` is null before using it.
- The code is not allocating memory for `d` before using it.
- The code is not deallocating memory for `d` after using it.
