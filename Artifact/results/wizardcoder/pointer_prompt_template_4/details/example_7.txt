'''
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code snippet given is a simple program that allocates memory for an integer using `malloc()` and assigns the value `15` to it. It then prints the value of the integer using `printf()` and then sets the pointer `ptr` to `NULL`. This is a common mistake that can occur when a programmer is not careful with memory management. 

The issue with this code is that the pointer `ptr` is being assigned `NULL` after it has been used to access the memory allocated for the integer. This can cause a segmentation fault or other runtime errors. Additionally, the `malloc()` function is not being properly freed or deallocated, which can lead to memory leaks or other issues. 

To fix this issue, the programmer should always ensure that the memory allocated by `malloc()` is properly deallocated using `free()` or a similar function. Additionally, the pointer `ptr` should not be dereferenced after it has been set to `NULL`.<|endoftext|>
