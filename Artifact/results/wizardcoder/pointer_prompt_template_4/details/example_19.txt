### Response:
The code snippet given by triple backticks is a function `pure_strcmp` that compares two strings using `pure_memcmp`. The `pure_memcmp` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the first string, a pointer to the second string, and the length of the strings. The function compares the bytes of the two strings and returns 0 if they are equal, a negative value if the first string is less than the second string, and a positive value if the first string is greater than the second string.

The `pure_strcmp` function first calls `strlen` to get the length of the first string, adds 1 to account for the null terminator, and passes this length and the two string pointers to `pure_memcmp`. The `pure_memcmp` function then compares the bytes of the two strings and returns 0 if they are equal, a negative value if the first string is less than the second string, and a positive value if the first string is greater than the second string.

The code snippet does not have any issues with bad pointer arithmetic, unsafe dereferencing, buffer overflow or buffer underwrite, bad allocation / deallocation, or improper sanitization of input.<|endoftext|>
