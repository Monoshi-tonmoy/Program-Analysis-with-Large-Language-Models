### Instruction:
Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
'''

### Response:
The code snippet given by triple backticks is a function `fun10()` that allocates memory for an integer using `malloc()` and then assigns the value of `50` to it. It then loops through `25` iterations and multiplies the value of `i` with `50` and assigns it to the memory location pointed to by `ptr`. Finally, it deallocates the memory using `free()` without checking if the memory has been deallocated or not. This can lead to memory leaks and other issues such as buffer overflow or buffer underwrite. Additionally, the code snippet is not properly sanitizing the input, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.<|endoftext|>
