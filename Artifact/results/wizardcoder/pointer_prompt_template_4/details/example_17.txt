### Instruction:
Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int *fun(){  
    int y=10;  
    return &y;  
}  
int main()  
{  
    int *p=fun();  
    printf("%d", *p);  
    return 0;  
}
'''

### Response:
The code snippet given is a simple program that defines a function `fun()` that returns a pointer to an integer variable `y` and then calls `printf()` to print the value of `y`. The `main()` function then calls `fun()` to get a pointer to `y` and dereferences it to print its value.

The code snippet does not have any issues with bad pointer arithmetic, unsafe dereferencing, buffer overflow or buffer underwrite, bad allocation / deallocation, or improper sanitization of input.<|endoftext|>
