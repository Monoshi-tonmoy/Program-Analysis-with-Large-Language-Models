### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int *p = x;
char * second_char = (char *)(p + 1);
```

### Response:
The code declares a pointer `p` to an integer variable `x`. It then casts the pointer to a `char` pointer and adds 1 to it to get a pointer to the second character in the integer variable. This is because the `char` type is smaller than the `int` type, so a pointer to a `char` can point to a memory location that contains an `int`.<|endoftext|>
