You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;)
    if (**ap!= '\0')
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;

free(ap[4]);
```

### Response:
The code initializes a pointer `ap` to `argv`, and then uses `strsep()` to separate the input string `inputstring` into words using whitespace as the delimiter. The resulting words are stored in the array `argv` up to the first 10 elements. The loop continues until `strsep()` returns `NULL`, indicating that there are no more words in the input string.

After the loop, `ap` points to the first element of the array `argv` that contains a non-null string. The loop increments `ap` until it points to the 10th element of the array, at which point the loop is terminated.

Finally, the code calls `free()` on the pointer `ap[4]`, which is the fifth element of the array `argv`. This is because `ap` points to the first element of the array, and `ap[4]` points to the fifth element of the array.<|endoftext|>
