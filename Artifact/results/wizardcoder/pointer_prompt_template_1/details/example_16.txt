You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 20;
    free(ptr); 
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code allocates memory for an integer using `malloc()` function and assigns the value 20 to it using the dereferenced pointer `*ptr`. Then it frees the memory using `free()` function. Finally, it prints the value of the pointer `*ptr` which is now a dangling pointer. This is because the memory allocated using `malloc()` is not automatically deallocated by the system. It is the responsibility of the programmer to free the memory using `free()` function.<|endoftext|>
