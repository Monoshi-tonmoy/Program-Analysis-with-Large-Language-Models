You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int bar() { int a = 12, b = 24; int *sum = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); *sum = a + b; printf("%d\n", *sum); printf("%d\n", *sum); return 0; }
```

### Response:
The code declares two integer variables `a` and `b`, and then dynamically allocates memory for an integer variable `sum` using `malloc()`. The `sum` pointer is then assigned the address of the dynamically allocated memory. The value of `a` and `b` are added together and stored in the memory pointed to by `sum`. The code then prints the value of `*sum` twice, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.

The `malloc()` function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, which is stored in the `sum` pointer. The `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer to access the value stored in the memory it points to.

Therefore, the code is correct and does not have any memory leaks or dangling pointers.<|endoftext|>
