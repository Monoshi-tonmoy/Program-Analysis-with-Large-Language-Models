### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)

int contains_char(char c){
    char *str;
    str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
    while( *str!= NULL){
        if( *str == c ){
            /* matched char, free string and return success */
            free(str);
            return SUCCESS;
        }
        /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
        str = str + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */

    free(str);
    return FAILURE;
}
```

### Response:
The code defines two constants `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE` as 1 and 0 respectively. It then defines a function `contains_char` which takes a character `c` as input and returns either `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` depending on whether the character is present in the string "Search Me!".

The function first allocates memory for a string of 20 characters using `malloc` and copies the string "Search Me!" into it using `strcpy`. It then loops through the string, checking each character against the input character `c`. If a match is found, the function frees the memory allocated for the string and returns `SUCCESS`. If no match is found, the function continues to the next character in the string and repeats the process until either a match is found or the end of the string is reached.

If no match is found, the function frees the memory allocated for the string and returns `FAILURE`.

The function does not modify the input character `c` or the string "Search Me!", so it does not violate any of the rules of the C programming language.<|endoftext|>
