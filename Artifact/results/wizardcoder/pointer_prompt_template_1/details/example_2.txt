You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun3() {
    int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int *ptr = arr;
    int value = *(ptr + 6);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code defines an integer array `arr` with 5 elements, and a pointer `ptr` that points to the first element of the array. The code then tries to access the element at index 6 of the array using the pointer, which is not valid. Therefore, the code will result in a segmentation fault.<|endoftext|>
