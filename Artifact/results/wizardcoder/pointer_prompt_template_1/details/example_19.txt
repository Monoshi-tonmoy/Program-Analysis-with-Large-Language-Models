### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int pure_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
   const unsigned char *b1 = (const unsigned char *) b1_;
   const unsigned char *b2 = (const unsigned char *) b2_;
   size_t i;
   unsigned char d = (unsigned char) 0 U;
   for (i = 0 U; i < len; i++) {
        d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
   }
   return (int)((1 &((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1);
}

int pure_strcmp(const char *const s1, const char *const s2) {
    return pure_memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(s1) + 1 U);
}
```

### Response:
The `pure_memcmp` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the first buffer, a pointer to the second buffer, and the length of the buffers. It returns an integer value that represents the difference between the two buffers.

The function uses a loop to compare each byte of the two buffers. It uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to accumulate the differences between the bytes.

After the loop, the function returns the difference between the accumulated differences and 1. If the accumulated differences are greater than or equal to 256, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the difference.

The `pure_strcmp` function is similar to `pure_memcmp`, but it takes two pointers to null-terminated strings as arguments. It calls `pure_memcmp` with the lengths of the strings plus 1.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows best practices for memory safety and security.<|endoftext|>
