You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int foo(struc ptr*) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code is trying to free two pointers `ptr->member` and `ptr->field`. However, `ptr` is a pointer to a structure, not a pointer to a pointer. Therefore, the code is not correct. The correct way to free the pointers is to dereference `ptr` and then free the members. Here's the corrected code:

```
int foo(struc *ptr) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
```

This code will correctly free the two pointers `ptr->member` and `ptr->field`.<|endoftext|>
