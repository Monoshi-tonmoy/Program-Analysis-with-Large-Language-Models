You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code allocates memory for an integer using `malloc()` and then assigns a pointer `ptr` to it. The pointer is then used to assign the value of `val` multiplied by the loop variable `i` to the memory location pointed to by `ptr`. The `free()` function is then called to deallocate the memory allocated by `malloc()`.

Therefore, the code is not leaking memory, as `malloc()` and `free()` are used to manage the memory allocation and deallocation. However, the code is not free from errors, as the pointer `ptr` is not being properly initialized before being used. Additionally, the loop condition is set to 25, which means that the memory allocated by `malloc()` will not be properly deallocated.<|endoftext|>
