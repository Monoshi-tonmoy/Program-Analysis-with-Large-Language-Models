### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    while(i < len) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
        i++;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return i;
}

int tx_int(char *ptr) {
    int val = OBJ_SIZE;
    while(val < OBJ_SIZE) {
        send_msg(ptr, 16);
    }
    free(ptr);
}
```

### Response:
The code defines two functions: `send_msg` and `tx_int`. `send_msg` takes a pointer `ptr` and a length `len` as input and writes `len` number of bytes from `ptr` to a buffer. It then frees the memory allocated for `ptr`. `tx_int` takes a pointer `ptr` as input and sends `OBJ_SIZE` number of bytes from `ptr` to a receiver. It then frees the memory allocated for `ptr`.

The code seems to be correct and follows the basic rules of pointer usage. However, there is one potential issue with the code.

In `send_msg`, the loop variable `i` is incremented inside the loop, but it is not used anywhere else. This means that the loop will run indefinitely, potentially causing a memory leak. To fix this, we can simply remove the loop variable `i` and use the index of the current byte in the pointer instead. Here's the corrected code:

```
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
    }
    free(ptr);
    return len;
}
```

This code should work correctly and avoid the memory leak.<|endoftext|>
