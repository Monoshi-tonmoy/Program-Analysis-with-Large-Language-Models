You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int *fun(){  
    int y=10;  
    return &y;  
}  
int main()  
{  
    int *p=fun();  
    printf("%d", *p);  
    return 0;  
}
```

### Response:
The code defines a function `fun()` that returns a pointer to an integer variable `y`. The function initializes `y` to 10 and returns a pointer to `y`. In the `main()` function, `p` is assigned the return value of `fun()`. The `*` operator is used to dereference `p` and access the value pointed to by it, which is 10. Therefore, the output of the program will be `10`.<|endoftext|>
