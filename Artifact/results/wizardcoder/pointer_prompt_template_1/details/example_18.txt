### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun() {
    nresp = packet_get_int();
    if (nresp > 0) {
    response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
    for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
        response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
    }
}
```

### Response:
The code defines a function `fun()` that reads an integer `nresp` from the network and then checks if it is greater than 0. If it is, it reads `nresp` strings from the network and stores them in an array `response`. The `response` array is dynamically allocated using `xmalloc()` and each string is dynamically allocated using `packet_get_string()`. The `response` array is then returned to the caller.

The code does not use any pointers, but it does use dynamic memory allocation. The `response` array is dynamically allocated using `xmalloc()` and each string is dynamically allocated using `packet_get_string()`. The `response` array is then returned to the caller.

Therefore, the code does not use any pointers.<|endoftext|>
