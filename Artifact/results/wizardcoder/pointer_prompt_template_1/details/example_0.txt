You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun1() {
    int i;
    char arr1[2];
    char arr2[10];
    /*... */
    for (i = 0; i!= 10; ++i) {
        ((short*)arr1)[0] = arr2[i];
        arr1[1] = arr2[9-i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code defines three arrays: `arr1` and `arr2` are both of type `char`, and `arr2` is of size 10. The `for` loop iterates 10 times, and for each iteration, it assigns the value of `arr2[i]` to the first element of `arr1` (which is a `short*`), and the value of `arr2[9-i]` to the second element of `arr1`.

The `((short*)arr1)` cast is necessary because `arr1` is of type `char`, but we need to assign a `short` value to it. The `arr1[1]` assignment is also a bit tricky, because `arr1` is an array of `char`, but we need to assign a `char` value to it.

Overall, the code seems correct and should work as expected.<|endoftext|>
