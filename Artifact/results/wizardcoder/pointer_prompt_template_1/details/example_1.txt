You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code declares two integer variables `num` and `*intptr`. `*intptr` is a pointer to `num`. The code also declares a float pointer `floatptr` that points to the same memory location as `num`. 

The code then assigns the value `20.5` to the memory location pointed to by `floatptr`. Finally, the code prints the value of `num` and the value at `*floatptr`. 

The output of the code will be:
```
Value of num: 20
Value at floatptr: 20.500000
```

The code is correct and will work as expected.<|endoftext|>
