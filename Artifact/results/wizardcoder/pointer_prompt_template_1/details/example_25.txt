### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
    struct hostent *hp;
    in_addr_t *addr;
    char hostname[64];
    in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);

    /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */

    validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);
    addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);
    hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET); // can return null
    strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
}
```

### Response:
The code defines a function `host_lookup` that takes a pointer to a string `user_supplied_addr`. The function first defines a `struct hostent` pointer `hp`, an `in_addr_t` pointer `addr`, and a character array `hostname` of size 64. It also defines a function `inet_addr` that converts a string representation of an IP address to an `in_addr_t` value.

The function then calls a function `validate_addr_form` that ensures that `user_supplied_addr` is in the correct format for conversion to an `in_addr_t` value. This function is not shown in the code.

The function then calls the `gethostbyaddr` function to look up the hostname associated with the IP address in `user_supplied_addr`. The `gethostbyaddr` function takes three arguments: the address to look up, the length of the address, and the address family (in this case, `AF_INET`). The function returns a pointer to a `struct hostent` structure that contains information about the hostname.

If `gethostbyaddr` returns a null pointer, the function sets `hp` to null and returns. Otherwise, the function copies the hostname from the `struct hostent` structure to the `hostname` character array.

The function then returns the `hostname` character array.

The `gethostbyaddr` function is a standard function in most operating systems that allows you to look up information about a hostname or IP address. It is used in this code to look up the hostname associated with an IP address.<|endoftext|>
