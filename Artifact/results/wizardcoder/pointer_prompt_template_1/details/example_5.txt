### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun6(int *d) {
    int val = *d;
    val += 10;
    return val;
}
```

### Response:
The function `fun6` takes a pointer `d` to an integer as input. It reads the value pointed to by `d` into a local variable `val`. It then adds 10 to `val` and returns the result.

The pointer `d` is an input parameter to the function. It is used to pass the address of an integer to the function. The function then reads the value at the address pointed to by `d` and stores it in a local variable `val`. The function then modifies the value of `val` by adding 10 and returns the modified value.

Therefore, the function `fun6` does not modify the value of the integer that it is pointed to. It only reads the value and returns the modified value.<|endoftext|>
