You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
struct Ex {
    int field;
};

int fun5(struct Ex *d) {
    int val;
    if (d->field) 
        val = 1;

    if (d->field)
        val = 2;
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code defines a structure `Ex` with a single field `field`. The function `fun5` takes a pointer to an `Ex` object as an argument. The function initializes a variable `val` to 0. 

The first `if` statement checks if `d->field` is non-zero. If it is, then `val` is set to 1. 

The second `if` statement also checks if `d->field` is non-zero. However, since `val` is already 1, the second `if` statement is not executed. 

Finally, the function returns 0. 

Therefore, the code is correct and does not have any pointer issues.<|endoftext|>
