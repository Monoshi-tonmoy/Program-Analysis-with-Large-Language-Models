### Instruction:
Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun9() {
    int *ptr;
    *ptr = 15;
    int temp = *ptr;
    free(ptr);
    return temp;
}
```

### Response:
The code defines a function `fun9()` that takes no arguments and returns an integer. The function declares a pointer variable `ptr` of type `int *`, which is initialized to `NULL`. The function then assigns the value `15` to the memory location pointed to by `ptr`. The function then creates a local variable `temp` and assigns the value pointed to by `ptr` to `temp`. Finally, the function calls the `free()` function to deallocate the memory pointed to by `ptr`, and returns `temp`.

The code is not a good example of pointer usage because it does not follow best practices for memory management. First, the pointer is not initialized to a valid memory location, which can lead to undefined behavior if the pointer is dereferenced. Second, the `free()` function is called on a pointer that was not allocated by the program, which can lead to memory leaks or other issues. Finally, the function does not return a pointer to the allocated memory, which can lead to confusion and errors if the pointer is used later in the program.<|endoftext|>
