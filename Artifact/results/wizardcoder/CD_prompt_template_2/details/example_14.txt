You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency in the while loop. The variable `max` is used to check if it is divisible by `x` and `y`. However, the value of `max` is incremented inside the loop, which means that the value of `max` will keep increasing and eventually become greater than `x` and `y`. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will never terminate. 

To fix this cyclic dependency, we need to modify the while loop to stop when `max` becomes greater than the product of `x` and `y`. This will ensure that the program terminates and the correct LCM is returned. 

Here is the modified program:

```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (max <= x * y) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

In the modified program, we have added a condition to the while loop to stop when `max` becomes greater than the product of `x` and `y`. This will ensure that the program terminates and the correct LCM is returned.<|endoftext|>
