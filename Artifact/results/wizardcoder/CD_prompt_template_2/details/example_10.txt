You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the `factorial()` function and the `main()` function. 

The `factorial()` function calls itself recursively to calculate the factorial of a given number. This creates a cycle in the program, where the output of one function is used as an input to another function. 

To break this cycle, we can use a global variable to store the result of the factorial calculation and pass it as an argument to the `factorial()` function. This way, the `factorial()` function can use the result of the previous calculation instead of recalculating it. 

Here's the modified program:

```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n, unsigned int *result)
{
	if (n == 0) {
		*result = 1;
		return *result;
	}

	*result = n * factorial(n - 1, result);
	return *result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	unsigned int result = 0;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num, &result));
	return 0;
}
```

In the modified program, we have added a pointer `result` to the `factorial()` function, which will store the result of the factorial calculation. In the `main()` function, we have initialized the `result` variable to 0, and passed its address to the `factorial()` function. 

This way, the `factorial()` function can use the `result` variable to store the result of the previous calculation instead of recalculating it. This breaks the cycle and avoids infinite recursion.<|endoftext|>
