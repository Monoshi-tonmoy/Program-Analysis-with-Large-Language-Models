You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program has a cyclic dependency between the two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. The cyclic dependency is formed because the elements of `arr2` are pointers to the elements of `arr1`. This means that if we change the value of an element in `arr1`, then the corresponding element in `arr2` will also change, and vice versa. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will not terminate.

To analyze the cyclic dependency, we need to understand how the elements of `arr2` are being assigned to the elements of `arr1`. In the `main` function, we are initializing each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`. This means that if we change the value of an element in `arr1`, then the corresponding element in `arr2` will also change.

However, this is not enough to create a cycle in the program. To create a cycle, we need to modify the values of `arr1` indirectly, by changing the values of `arr2`. For example, if we change the value of `arr2[0][0]`, then the corresponding element in `arr1` will also change. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will not terminate.

Therefore, the cyclic dependency in the program is between the two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. The elements of `arr2` are pointers to the elements of `arr1`, and if we change the value of an element in `arr1`, then the corresponding element in `arr2` will also change. This creates a cycle in the program, which means that the program will not terminate.<|endoftext|>
