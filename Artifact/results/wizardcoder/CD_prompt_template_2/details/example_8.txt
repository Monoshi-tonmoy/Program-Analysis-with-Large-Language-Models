You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The given program has no cyclic dependencies. It is a simple program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. There are no functions or loops that depend on each other. Therefore, there is no cyclic dependency in this program.<|endoftext|>
