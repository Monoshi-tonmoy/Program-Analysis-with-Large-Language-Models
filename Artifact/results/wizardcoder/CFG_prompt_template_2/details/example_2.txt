You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program defines a function `checkEvenOdd` which takes an integer `N` as input.
3. The function finds the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator `%`.
4. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even" as the number is even.
5. Otherwise, the function prints "Odd" as the number is odd.
6. The program then calls the `checkEvenOdd` function with an input of 10.
7. The function finds the remainder of 10 divided by 2, which is 0.
8. The function prints "Even" as the number is even.
9. The program then calls the `checkEvenOdd` function with an input of 7.
10. The function finds the remainder of 7 divided by 2, which is 1.
11. The function prints "Odd" as the number is odd.

Therefore, the decision points and loops in the control flow of the program are:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files.
2. The program defines a function `checkEvenOdd` which takes an integer `N` as input.
3. The function finds the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator `%`.
4. If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even" as the number is even.
5. Otherwise, the function prints "Odd" as the number is odd.
6. The program then calls the `checkEvenOdd` function with an input of 10.
7. The function finds the remainder of 10 divided by 2, which is 0.
8. The function prints "Even" as the number is even.
9. The program then calls the `checkEvenOdd` function with an input of 7.
10. The function finds the remainder of 7 divided by 2, which is 1.
11. The function prints "Odd" as the number is odd.<|endoftext|>
