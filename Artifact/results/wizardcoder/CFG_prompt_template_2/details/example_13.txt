You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables `prev1` and `prev2` with values 1 and 0 respectively. These variables are used to store the previous two terms of the Fibonacci series.

2. The program then defines a recursive function `fib` that takes an integer argument `n` and prints the `n`th term of the Fibonacci series.

3. The `fib` function first checks if `n` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns without doing anything.

4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the `n`th term of the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two terms `prev1` and `prev2`. It then updates the values of `prev1` and `prev2` to the current values of `fn` and returns the result of calling `fib(n-1)`.

5. The program then defines a function `printFib` that takes an integer argument `n` and prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series.

6. The `printFib` function first checks if `n` is less than 1. If it is, the function prints an error message and returns.

7. If `n` is 1, the function prints the first term of the Fibonacci series, which is 0.

8. If `n` is 2, the function prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, which are 0 and 1.

9. If `n` is greater than 2, the function prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series, which are 0 and 1, and then calls the `fib` function to print the remaining terms of the series.

10. Finally, the program calls the `printFib` function with an argument of 9 to print the first 9 terms of the Fibonacci series.<|endoftext|>
