You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. In the `main()` function, an integer array `arr1` is declared with 5 rows and 5 columns.
3. An integer pointer array `arr2` is declared with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4. The program then initializes each element of the pointer array `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in the other array `arr1`.
5. The program then prints the values of the array `arr1` using the array of pointers `arr2`.
6. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in the control flow of the program.<|endoftext|>
