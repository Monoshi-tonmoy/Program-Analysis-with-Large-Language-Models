You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. Inside the `main()` function, we declare three variables `P`, `R`, and `T` and assign them values.
3. We then calculate the Simple Interest using the formula `(P * T * R) / 100` and store the result in the variable `SI`.
4. Finally, we print the value of `SI` using the `printf()` function.
5. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
