You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. The `print_table()` function is called with the range and the number as arguments.
3. The `for` loop is executed, which iterates from 1 to the range value.
4. Inside the loop, the product of the number and the current iteration value is calculated and stored in the `mul` variable.
5. The product is printed using the `printf()` function.
6. The `printf()` function is used to print the product on the same line.
7. After each iteration of the loop, the program proceeds to the next line using the `printf("\n")` statement.
8. After the loop completes, the program returns from the `main()` function.

Therefore, the decision points and loops in the control flow of the program are:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. The `print_table()` function is called with the range and the number as arguments.
3. The `for` loop is executed, which iterates from 1 to the range value.
4. Inside the loop, the product of the number and the current iteration value is calculated and stored in the `mul` variable.
5. The product is printed using the `printf()` function.
6. The `printf()` function is used to print the product on the same line.
7. After each iteration of the loop, the program proceeds to the next line using the `printf("\n")` statement.
8. After the loop completes, the program returns from the `main()` function.<|endoftext|>
