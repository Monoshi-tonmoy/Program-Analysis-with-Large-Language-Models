You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. In the `main()` function, a variable `f` is assigned the value of 40.
3. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function is called with the parameter `f`.
4. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function subtracts 32 from `f` and multiplies the result by 5/9 to convert it to Celsius.
5. The result is returned from the `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function and stored in a variable `c`.
6. The value of `c` is printed using `printf()` function.
7. The program exits from the `main()` function and terminates.

There are no decision points or loops in the program.<|endoftext|>
