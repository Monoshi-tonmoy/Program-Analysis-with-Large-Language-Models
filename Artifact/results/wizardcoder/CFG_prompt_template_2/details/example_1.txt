You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.

2. Inside the `main()` function, the program asks the user to enter two numbers `A` and `B`.

3. The `scanf()` function is used to read the two numbers from the user.

4. The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator.

5. Finally, the program prints the sum using the `printf()` function.

6. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in the control flow of the program.<|endoftext|>
