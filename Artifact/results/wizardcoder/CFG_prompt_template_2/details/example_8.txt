You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. Inside the `main()` function, we declare two integer variables `l` and `b` and initialize them with values `10`.
3. We then use the `printf()` function to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
4. The `printf()` function takes two arguments - the first argument is the string "Area of rectangle is : " and the second argument is the product of `l` and `b`.
5. The `printf()` function then takes two more arguments - the first argument is the string "Perimeter of rectangle is : " and the second argument is the sum of `l` and `b` multiplied by `2`.
6. Finally, the program returns `0` to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
