You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
2. The program prompts the user to enter an integer using the `printf()` function.
3. The `scanf()` function reads the user input and stores it in the `number` variable.
4. The program then displays the user input using the `printf()` function.
5. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

There are no decision points or loops in this program.<|endoftext|>
