You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the `main()` function.

2. In the `main()` function, two loops are executed. The first loop iterates from 65 to 90 and the second loop iterates from 97 to 122.

3. In each loop, the program checks if the current integer value is within the ASCII range of A-Z or a-z.

4. If the integer value is within the ASCII range of A-Z, the program converts the integer value to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and prints it.

5. If the integer value is within the ASCII range of a-z, the program converts the integer value to its corresponding character using the `(char)` operator and prints it.

6. After the loops have completed, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
