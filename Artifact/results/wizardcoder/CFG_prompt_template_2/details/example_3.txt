You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files for math.h, stdio.h, and stdlib.h.

2. The program defines a function called findRoots that takes three integer arguments a, b, and c.

3. The function first checks if a is equal to 0. If it is, then the equation is not quadratic, but linear, and the function returns an error message.

4. If a is not equal to 0, the function calculates the discriminant d of the quadratic equation ax*2 + bx + c.

5. The function then calculates the square root of the absolute value of d.

6. If d is greater than 0, the function prints that the roots are real and different, and then calculates and prints the two roots using the quadratic formula.

7. If d is equal to 0, the function prints that the roots are real and same, and then calculates and prints the single root using the quadratic formula.

8. If d is less than 0, the function prints that the roots are complex, and then calculates and prints the two complex roots using the quadratic formula.

9. The main function then calls the findRoots function with the values of a, b, and c.

10. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.<|endoftext|>
