You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

### Instruction:
Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts executing from the main() function.
2. In the main() function, the value of num is assigned to 5.
3. The printf() function is called to display the factorial of num.
4. The factorial() function is called with num as the argument.
5. In the factorial() function, a variable result is initialized to 1.
6. A for loop is used to iterate from 2 to n (where n is the argument passed to the factorial() function).
7. In each iteration of the loop, the value of result is multiplied by i.
8. After the loop completes, the value of result is returned.
9. The value returned by the factorial() function is stored in a variable called result.
10. The value of result is then printed using the printf() function.
11. The program then exits from the main() function.

There are no decision points or loops in the program.<|endoftext|>
