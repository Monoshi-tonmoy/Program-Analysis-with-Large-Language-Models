You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int bar() { int a = 12, b = 24; int *sum = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); *sum = a + b; printf("%d\n", *sum); printf("%d\n", *sum); return 0; }
```

### Response:
There are no issues with the given pointer use. The pointer `sum` is dynamically allocated using `malloc()` and initialized to the sum of `a` and `b`. The pointer `sum` is then dereferenced twice, which returns the sum of `a` and `b` twice. The output of the program is:
```
36
36
```
which is the expected result.<|endoftext|>
