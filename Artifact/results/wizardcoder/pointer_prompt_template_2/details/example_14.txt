You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);
  if(modified!= 0) {
    printf("you have changed the'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
    printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

### Response:
The use of `volatile` keyword is not recommended for `modified` variable as it can lead to unexpected behavior. The `gets()` function is used to read input from the user, which can cause buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `modified` variable is not being checked for any specific value, so it is not possible to determine if it has been modified or not. Therefore, it is recommended to use a different approach to check if the variable has been modified or not.<|endoftext|>
