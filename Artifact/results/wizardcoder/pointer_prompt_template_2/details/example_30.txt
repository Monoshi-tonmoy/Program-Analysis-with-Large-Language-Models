You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    char *items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};
    int index = GetUntrustedOffset();
    printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);}
```

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and should work as expected. However, there is a potential issue with the use of `GetUntrustedOffset()` function. This function is not defined anywhere in the code and it is not clear what it does. It is also not clear what the return value of this function should be. 

Additionally, the code assumes that the user input is always valid and within the bounds of the `items` array. It is possible that the user input can be out of bounds, which can cause a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior. 

To fix these issues, it is recommended to define `GetUntrustedOffset()` function and make sure that it returns a valid index within the bounds of the `items` array.<|endoftext|>
