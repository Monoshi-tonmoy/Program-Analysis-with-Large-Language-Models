### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int *fun(){  
    int y=10;  
    return &y;  
}  
int main()  
{  
    int *p=fun();  
    printf("%d", *p);  
    return 0;  
}
```

### Response:
There are no issues with the given code. The `fun()` function returns the address of a local variable `y` which is a static variable. The `main()` function then assigns the returned address to a pointer `p` and dereferences it to print its value. This is a valid use of pointers in C.<|endoftext|>
