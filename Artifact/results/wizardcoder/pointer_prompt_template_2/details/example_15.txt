### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int foo(struc ptr*) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
There are no issues with the given code. The `ptr` parameter is a pointer to a structure, which means that it can be `NULL` if no structure is passed to the function. The `free` function is used to deallocate memory allocated by the `malloc` function. Therefore, the code should work as expected.<|endoftext|>
