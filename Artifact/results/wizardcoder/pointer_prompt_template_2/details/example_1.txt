### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and should work as expected. However, it is worth noting that the pointer `floatptr` is being cast to `(float *)` which is not necessary since `floatptr` is already a pointer to a `float`. Therefore, the cast is unnecessary and can be removed. Additionally, the `printf` statement for `floatptr` is printing the value of the `float` variable pointed to by `floatptr`, which is 20.5 in this case.<|endoftext|>
