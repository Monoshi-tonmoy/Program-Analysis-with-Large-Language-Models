### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun6(int *d) {
    int val = *d;
    val += 10;
    return val;
}
```

### Response:
There are no issues with the given pointer use. The function `fun6` takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and returns the value pointed to by the pointer plus 10. This is a valid use of a pointer in C.<|endoftext|>
