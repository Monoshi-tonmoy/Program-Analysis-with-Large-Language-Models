You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun1() {
    int i;
    char arr1[2];
    char arr2[10];
    /*... */
    for (i = 0; i!= 10; ++i) {
        ((short*)arr1)[0] = arr2[i];
        arr1[1] = arr2[9-i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The code seems to be correct and should work as expected. However, it is worth noting that the pointer arithmetic used in the loop is not portable across different platforms. In particular, it may not work correctly on platforms where the size of `short` is not equal to 2 bytes. To make the code more portable, it would be better to use a `char*` pointer instead of a `short*` pointer, and then cast the pointer to `short*` as needed. For example:

```
int fun1() {
    int i;
    char arr1[2];
    char arr2[10];
    /*... */
    for (i = 0; i!= 10; ++i) {
        char* ptr = (char*)&arr1[0];
        *ptr = arr2[i];
        ptr = (char*)&arr1[1];
        *ptr = arr2[9-i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code should work correctly on all platforms, regardless of the size of `short`.<|endoftext|>
