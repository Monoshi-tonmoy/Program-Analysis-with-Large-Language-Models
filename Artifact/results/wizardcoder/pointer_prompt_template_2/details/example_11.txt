### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
typedef struct elem_list {
    int val;
    struct elem_list *next;
} Elements;

int elem_member(int val, Elements *c) {
    Elements *elem;
    for(elem == c; c!= NULL; elem = elem->next) {
        if(elem->val == val) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
The issue with the given code is that the `elem_member` function is not checking if the `c` parameter is `NULL` before iterating over the linked list. This can lead to a segmentation fault if `c` is `NULL` and the function is called. 

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that `c` is not `NULL` before iterating over the linked list. Here's the corrected code:

```
typedef struct elem_list {
    int val;
    struct elem_list *next;
} Elements;

int elem_member(int val, Elements *c) {
    if(c == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }
    Elements *elem;
    for(elem = c; elem!= NULL; elem = elem->next) {
        if(elem->val == val) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `c` is `NULL`. If it is, we immediately return `0` since there are no elements in the linked list to search through. If `c` is not `NULL`, we proceed with iterating over the linked list as before.<|endoftext|>
