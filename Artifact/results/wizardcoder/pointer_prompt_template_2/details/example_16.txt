You are a super smart Program Analyst.

### Instruction:
Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 20;
    free(ptr); 
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Response:
There are no issues with the given code. The `malloc()` function returns a pointer to a memory block of the specified size, which is then casted to an `int*` pointer. The `free()` function is used to deallocate the memory block, which is then dereferenced to access the value stored in it. This code is correct and will not cause any issues.<|endoftext|>
