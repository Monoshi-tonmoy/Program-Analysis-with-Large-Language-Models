You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
```

Output
```
Even
```

Explanation

The program checks if the number is even or odd.

The function checkEvenOdd() takes an integer N as an argument.

Inside the function, the remainder of N and 2 is calculated.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

Otherwise, the number is odd.

The function checkEvenOdd() prints the result.

The main() function calls the checkEvenOdd() function.

The checkEvenOdd() function prints the result.

The main() function prints the result.

The program ends.
