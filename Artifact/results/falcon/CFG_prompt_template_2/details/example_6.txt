You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
```

Output
```
Temperature in Degree Celsius : 4.44
```

Explanation

The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts with the main function.
2. The main function calls the fahrenheit_to_celsius function.
3. The fahrenheit_to_celsius function receives the value of f as 40.
4. The fahrenheit_to_celsius function returns the value of c as 4.44.
5. The main function prints the value of c as 4.44.
6. The program ends.
