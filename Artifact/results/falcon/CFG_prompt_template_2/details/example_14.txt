You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

Output
```
The LCM of 15 and 25 is 75. 
```

Explanation

The program takes two numbers as input and finds the LCM of the two numbers. The program uses a while loop to check if the max variable is divisible by x and y. If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the LCM of the two numbers.

The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program takes two numbers as input.
2. The program checks if the max variable is divisible by x and y.
3. If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the LCM of the two numbers.
4. If the condition is not satisfied, the program increments the max variable and checks again.
5. The program repeats the steps until the condition is satisfied.
6. The program prints the LCM of the two numbers.
7. The program terminates.
