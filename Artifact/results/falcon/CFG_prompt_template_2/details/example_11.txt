You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

Output
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: +
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 + 20 = 30
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: -
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 - 20 = -10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: *
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 * 20 = 200
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: /
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 / 20 = 0.5
```

Explanation:

The program is a simple calculator. The user will enter two operands and an operator. Based on the operator, the program will perform the operation.

The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program will ask the user to enter an operator.
2. The user will enter an operator.
3. The program will ask the user to enter two operands.
4. The user will enter two operands.
5. The program will perform the operation based on the operator.
6. The program will print the result.
7. The program will ask the user to enter an operator.
8. The user will enter an operator.
9. The program will go to step 3.
10. The program will go to step 5.
11. The program will go to step 7.
12. The program will go to step 9.
13. The program will go to step 11.
14. The program will go to step 13.
15. The program will go to step 11.
16. The program will go to step 13.
17. The program will go to step 11.
18. The program will go to step 13.
19. The program will go to step 11.
20. The program will go to step 13.
21. The program will go to step 11.
