You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Alphabets from (A-Z) are:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Alphabets from (a-z) are:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
```
