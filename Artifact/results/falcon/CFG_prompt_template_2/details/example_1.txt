You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Enter two numbers A and B : 
2
3
Sum of A and B is: 5
```

Explanation

The program asks the user to enter two numbers.

The user enters 2 and 3.

The program adds the two numbers and prints the sum.

The program then returns 0.

The program flow is as follows:

```
Enter two numbers A and B : 
2
3
Sum of A and B is: 5
```
