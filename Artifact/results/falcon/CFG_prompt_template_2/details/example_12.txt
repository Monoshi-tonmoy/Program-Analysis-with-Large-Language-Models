You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
```

Output
```
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
```

Explanation:

The program has two decision points:

1. The first decision point is the for loop.
2. The second decision point is the if statement.

The program has two loops:

1. The first loop is the for loop.
2. The second loop is the while loop.

The program has two paths:

1. The first path is the if statement.
2. The second path is the while loop.

The program has two exits:

1. The first exit is the if statement.
2. The second exit is the while loop.

The program has two branches:

1. The first branch is the if statement.
2. The second branch is the while loop.

The program has two jumps:

1. The first jump is the if statement.
2. The second jump is the while loop.
