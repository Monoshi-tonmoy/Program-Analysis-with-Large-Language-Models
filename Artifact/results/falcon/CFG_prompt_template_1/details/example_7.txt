You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
```

Output
```
Simple Interest = 100.0
```

Explanation

The program takes three inputs from the user: principal amount (P), rate of interest (R) and time (T).

The program calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100.

The program prints the simple interest.
