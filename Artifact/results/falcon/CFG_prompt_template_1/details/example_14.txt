You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y)? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
```

Output
```
The LCM of 15 and 25 is 75. 
```

Explanation

The program takes two numbers as input and finds the LCM of the two numbers.

The program starts by initializing two variables x and y.

The while loop checks if the max variable is divisible by x and y.

If the condition is true, the program prints the LCM of the two numbers.

If the condition is false, the program increments the value of max.

The program continues until the condition becomes true.

The program prints the LCM of the two numbers.

The program terminates.
