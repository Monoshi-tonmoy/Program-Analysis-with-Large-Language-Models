You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.


Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
```

Output
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: +
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 + 20 = 30
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: -
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 - 20 = -10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: *
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 * 20 = 200
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: /
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 / 20 = 0.5
```

Explanation
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: +
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 + 20 = 30
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: -
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 - 20 = -10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: *
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 * 20 = 200
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: /
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 / 20 = 0.5
```

The control flow of the program is:
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: +
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 + 20 = 30
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x: -
Enter two first and second operand: 10 20
10 - 20 = -10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), if want to exit press x:
