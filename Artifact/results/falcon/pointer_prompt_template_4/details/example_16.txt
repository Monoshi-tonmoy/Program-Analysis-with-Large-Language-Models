Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 20;
    free(ptr); 
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

20

Explanation

The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow.

The code snippet allocates memory for an integer and stores the value 20 in it.

The code snippet then prints the value stored in the allocated memory.

The code snippet then frees the allocated memory.

The code snippet then prints the value stored in the allocated memory.

The code snippet prints 20, which is the value stored in the allocated memory.
