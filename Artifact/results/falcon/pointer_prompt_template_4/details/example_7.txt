Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

15

Explanation

The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow.

The code snippet allocates memory for an integer and stores the value 15 in it.

The code snippet then prints the value stored in the allocated memory.

The code snippet then deallocates the memory allocated for the integer.

The code snippet then tries to access the deallocated memory.

The code snippet then prints the value stored in the deallocated memory.

The code snippet then prints 15.
