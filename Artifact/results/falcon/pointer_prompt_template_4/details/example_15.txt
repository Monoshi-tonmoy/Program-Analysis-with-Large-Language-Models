Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
int foo(struc ptr*) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

Bad pointer arithmetic

free() is a function that deallocates memory.

free(ptr->member) deallocates the memory pointed to by ptr->member.

free(ptr->field) deallocates the memory pointed to by ptr->field.

free(ptr) deallocates the memory pointed to by ptr.
