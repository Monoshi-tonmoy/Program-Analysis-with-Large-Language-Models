Analyze this code snippet given by triple backticks for the following:
-Bad pointer arithmetic
-Unsafe dereferencing
-Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
-Bad allocation / deallocation
-Improper sanitization of input

'''
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)

int contains_char(char c){

Output

Bad pointer arithmetic
Unsafe dereferencing
Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite
Bad allocation / deallocation
Improper sanitization of input
