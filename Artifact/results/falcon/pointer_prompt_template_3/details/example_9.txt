You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
'''
