You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int foo(int SIZE) {
    char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
    if (err) {
        abrt = 1;
        free(ptr);
    }

    // Some code here

    if (abrt) {
        logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
    }
}
'''
