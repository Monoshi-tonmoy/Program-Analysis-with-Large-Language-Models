You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun3() {
    int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int *ptr = arr;
    int value = *(ptr + 6);
    return 0;
}
'''
