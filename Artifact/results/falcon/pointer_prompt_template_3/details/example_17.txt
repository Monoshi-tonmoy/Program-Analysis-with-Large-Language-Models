You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int *fun(){  
    int y=10;  
    return &y;  
}  
int main()  
{  
    int *p=fun();  
    printf("%d", *p);  
    return 0;  
}
'''

Output

The output of the program is 10.

Explanation

The program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function fun() returns a pointer to a local variable y, which is overwritten by the printf() function. The printf() function writes the value 10 to the address pointed to by p.

The output of the program is 10.
