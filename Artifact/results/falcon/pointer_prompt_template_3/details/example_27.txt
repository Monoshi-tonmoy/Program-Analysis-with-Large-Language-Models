You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;)
    if (**ap!= '\0')
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;

free(ap[4]);
'''
