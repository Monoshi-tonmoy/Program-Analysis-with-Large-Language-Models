You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun1() {
    int i;
    char arr1[2];
    char arr2[10];
    /*... */
    for (i = 0; i!= 10; ++i) {
        ((short*)arr1)[0] = arr2[i];
        arr1[1] = arr2[9-i];
    }
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

The code contains a memory, buffer, or pointer misuse.

The code does not contain a memory, buffer, or pointer misuse.

The code contains a memory, buffer, or pointer misuse, but the misuse is not related to the code enclosed in triple backticks.
