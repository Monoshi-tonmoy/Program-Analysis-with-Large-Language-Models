You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 20;
    free(ptr); 
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

20

Explanation

The code allocates memory for an integer and stores the value 20 in it. The memory is freed and the value is printed.

The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The allocated memory is not large enough to store the value 20. The value 20 is stored in the memory allocated for the pointer, which overwrites the return address of the function. The attacker can then use the return address to execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable to a pointer misuse attack. The allocated memory is not large enough to store the value 20. The value 20 is stored in the memory allocated for the pointer, which overwrites the return address of the function. The attacker can then use the return address to execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable to a memory leak attack. The allocated memory is not freed, and the value 20 is stored in the memory allocated for the pointer. The attacker can then use the return address to execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack. The allocated memory is not freed, and the value 20 is stored in the memory allocated for the pointer. The attacker can then use the return address to execute arbitrary code.

The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack. The allocated memory is not freed, and the value 20 is stored in the memory allocated for the pointer. The attacker can then use the return address to execute arbitrary code.
