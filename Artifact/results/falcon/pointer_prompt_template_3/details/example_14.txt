You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);
  if(modified!= 0) {
    printf("you have changed the'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
    printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
'''
