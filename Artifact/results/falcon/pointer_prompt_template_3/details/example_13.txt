You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
board_square_t *make_board() {
    #define MAX_DIM 100
    int m,n, error;
    board_square_t *board;
    printf("Please specify the board height: \n");
    error = scanf("%d", &m);
    if ( EOF == error ){
        die("No integer passed: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    printf("Please specify the board width: \n");
    error = scanf("%d", &n);
    if ( EOF == error ){
        die("No integer passed: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    if ( m > MAX_DIM || n > MAX_DIM ) {
        die("Value too large: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    board = (board_square_t*) malloc( m * n * sizeof(board_square_t));
    return board;
}
'''

Output

Please specify the board height: 
Please specify the board width: 
Value too large: Die evil hacker!
