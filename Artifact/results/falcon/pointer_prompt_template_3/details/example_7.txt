You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
'''

Output

15

Explanation

The code allocates memory for an integer and stores the value 15 in it. The memory is freed and the pointer is set to NULL.
