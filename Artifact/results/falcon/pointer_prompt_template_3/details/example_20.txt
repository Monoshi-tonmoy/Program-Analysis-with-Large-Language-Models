You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char hostname[MAX_LEN];

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET);
            strcpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name);
            logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
}
'''

Output
'''
