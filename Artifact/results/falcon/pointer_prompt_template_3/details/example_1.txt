You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.


The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
'''

Output

Value of num: 10
Value at floatptr: 20.5
