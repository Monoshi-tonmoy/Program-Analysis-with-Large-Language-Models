Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun4() {
    int *ptr = NULL;
    int value;
    value = *ptr;
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
value = 0
```

Explanation

The pointer ptr is pointing to NULL.

So, the value of ptr is 0.

The value of *ptr is 0.

So, the value of value is 0.

Hence, the output is value = 0.
