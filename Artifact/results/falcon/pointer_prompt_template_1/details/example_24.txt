Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int size(struct node* head) {
    struct node* current = head;
    struct node* tail;
    while (current!= NULL) {
        tail = current;
        current = current->next;
        }
    return tail - head;
}
```

Output
```
1
```

Explanation
```
The function size() is called with a pointer to the head of the linked list.
The function returns the number of nodes in the linked list.
The function traverses the linked list from the head to the tail.
The function returns the difference between the addresses of the head and tail pointers.
