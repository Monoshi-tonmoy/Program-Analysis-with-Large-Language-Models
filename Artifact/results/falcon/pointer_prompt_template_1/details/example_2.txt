Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun3() {
    int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int *ptr = arr;
    int value = *(ptr + 6);
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
0
```

Explanation

The pointer ptr is pointing to the first element of the array arr.

The value of ptr + 6 is (ptr + 6) = (arr + 6) = (0 + 6) = 6.

The value of *(ptr + 6) is *(arr + 6) = *(0 + 6) = *(6) = 0.

The value of *(ptr + 6) is 0.
