Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
typedef struct elem_list {
    int val;
    struct elem_list *next;
} Elements;

int elem_member(int val, Elements *c) {
    Elements *elem;
    for(elem == c; c!= NULL; elem = elem->next) {
        if(elem->val == val) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
1
