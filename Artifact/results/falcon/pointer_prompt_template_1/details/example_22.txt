Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int main() {
    strncpy(destBuf, &srcBuf[find(srcBuf, ch)], 1024);
}
```

Output
```
destBuf = 0x7fff5fbfd000
srcBuf = 0x7fff5fbfc000
ch = 0x7fff5fbfc000
find = 0x7fff5fbfc000
```

What is the value of destBuf?

A. 0x7fff5fbfd000
B. 0x7fff5fbfc000
C. 0x7fff5fbfc100
D. 0x7fff5fbfc200
