Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Value of num: 10
Value at floatptr: 20.5
```

Explanation

The first pointer intptr points to the variable num.
The second pointer floatptr points to the variable num.
The value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr is 20.5 because the value of num is 10.

The value of num is 10 because the value of num is 10.
The value at floatptr
