Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;
for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t"))!= NULL;)
    if (**ap!= '\0')
        if (++ap >= &argv[10])
            break;

free(ap[4]);
```

Output
```
argv[0] = "hello"
argv[1] = "world"
argv[2] = "hello"
argv[3] = "world"
argv[4] = "hello"
argv[5] = "world"
argv[6] = "hello"
argv[7] = "world"
argv[8] = "hello"
argv[9] = "world"
```

What is the issue?

1. The pointer ap is not initialized
2. The pointer ap is not initialized to NULL
3. The pointer ap is not initialized to NULL and the loop will never terminate
4. The pointer ap is not initialized to NULL and the loop will never terminate and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack
5. The pointer ap is not initialized to NULL and the loop will never terminate and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack
6. The pointer ap is not initialized to NULL and the loop will never terminate and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack and the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack
