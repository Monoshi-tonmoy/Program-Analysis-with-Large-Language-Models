Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);
  if(modified!= 0) {
    printf("you have changed the'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
    printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

Output
```
you have changed the'modified' variable
```

Explanation

The `gets` function is a dangerous function. It reads a string from the standard input stream and stores it in the buffer. The `gets` function does not check for the length of the string. If the user enters more than 63 characters, the `gets` function will write to the memory beyond the allocated buffer. This will cause undefined behavior.

The `modified` variable is a volatile variable. It is not guaranteed to be updated by the `gets` function. The `gets` function does not update the `modified` variable. The `modified` variable is not updated until the `gets` function returns.

The `modified` variable is not updated until the `gets` function returns. The `gets` function does not return until the user enters a newline. The `gets` function does not return until the user enters a newline. The `gets` function does not return until the user enters a newline.
