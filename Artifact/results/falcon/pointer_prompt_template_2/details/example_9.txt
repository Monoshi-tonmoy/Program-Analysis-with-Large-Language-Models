Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
0
```

Explanation
```
The code allocates memory for a pointer and stores the address of the allocated memory in the pointer.
The code then stores the value 50 in the memory pointed to by the pointer.
The code then frees the memory pointed to by the pointer.
