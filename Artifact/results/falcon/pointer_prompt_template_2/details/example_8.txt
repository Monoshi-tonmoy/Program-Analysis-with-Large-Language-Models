Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun9() {
    int *ptr;
    *ptr = 15;
    int temp = *ptr;
    free(ptr);
    return temp;
}
```

Output
```
15
```

Explanation

The pointer ptr is allocated memory for an integer.
The value 15 is stored in the allocated memory.
The pointer ptr is freed.
The value 15 is returned.
