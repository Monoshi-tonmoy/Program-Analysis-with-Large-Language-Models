Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int foo(int SIZE) {
    char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
    if (err) {
        abrt = 1;
        free(ptr);
    }

    // Some code here

    if (abrt) {
        logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
    }
}
```

Output
```
There is a potential issue with the following pointer use.

The pointer 'ptr' is allocated in the 'if' block, but it is freed in the 'else' block.

The pointer 'ptr' is freed before the 'if' block is executed.
