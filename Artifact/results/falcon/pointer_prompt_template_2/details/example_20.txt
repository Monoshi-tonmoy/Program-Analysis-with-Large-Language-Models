Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int process_client() {
    struct hostent *clienthp;
    char hostname[MAX_LEN];

    // accept client connections and process requests
    int count = 0;
    for (count = 0; count < MAX_CONNECTIONS; count++) {

        int clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
        int clientsocket = accept(serversocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);

        if (clientsocket >= 0) {
            clienthp = gethostbyaddr((char*) &clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr, sizeof(clientaddr.sin_addr.s_addr), AF_INET);
            strcpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name);
            logOutput("Accepted client connection from host ", hostname);
            close(clientsocket);
        }
    }
    close(serversocket);
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Accepted client connection from host 127.0.0.1
Accepted client connection from host 127.0.0.1
Accepted client connection from host 127.0.0.1
Accepted client connection from host 127.0.0.1
```

What is the issue?

A. The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

B. The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow attack.

C. The code is vulnerable to a heap overflow attack.

D. The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack.

Answer: D

Explanation:

The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack.

The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack because the code is not checking for a null pointer before dereferencing it.

The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference attack because the code is not checking for a null pointer before dereferencing it.
