Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
15
```

Explanation

The pointer ptr is initialized with the address of the allocated memory.
The value 15 is stored at the memory location pointed by ptr.
The pointer ptr is then set to NULL.
The memory location pointed by ptr is freed.
The value 15 is still stored at the memory location pointed by ptr.
The value 15 is printed.

The value 15 is printed because the memory location pointed by ptr is not freed.
