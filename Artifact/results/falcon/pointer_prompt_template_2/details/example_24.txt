Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int size(struct node* head) {
    struct node* current = head;
    struct node* tail;
    while (current!= NULL) {
        tail = current;
        current = current->next;
        }
    return tail - head;
}
```

Output
```
0
```

Explanation
```
The function returns the number of nodes in the linked list.
