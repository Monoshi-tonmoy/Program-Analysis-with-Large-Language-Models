Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
struct Ex {
    int field;
};

int fun5(struct Ex *d) {
    int val;
    if (d->field) 
        val = 1;

    if (d->field)
        val = 2;
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
val = 2
```

Explanation

The pointer d is pointing to the same memory location.

The first if condition is true, so the value of val is set to 1.

The second if condition is also true, so the value of val is set to 2.
