Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    while(i < len) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
        i++;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return i;
}

int tx_int(char *ptr) {
    int val = OBJ_SIZE;
    while(val < OBJ_SIZE) {
        send_msg(ptr, 16);
    }
    free(ptr);
}
```

Output
```
