You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains functions for input and output.
2. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The `main` function initializes three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which are used to calculate the simple interest.
4. The program calculates the simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`.
5. The program prints the simple interest using the `printf` function.
6. The program returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

Note that the program does not have any loops or conditional statements, so the control flow is relatively simple.</s>
