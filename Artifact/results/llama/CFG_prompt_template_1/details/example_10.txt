Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  Sure, here's the control flow information for the program:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program then defines a function called `factorial` that takes an integer argument `n`.
3. The `factorial` function initializes a variable `result` to 1 and a variable `i` to 2.
4. The function then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n`, inclusive.
5. Inside the loop, the function multiplies `result` by `i`, and then increments `i` by 1.
6. After the loop exits, the function returns `result`.
7. The program then defines a `main` function that takes no arguments.
8. The `main` function initializes a variable `num` to 5.
9. The function then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as an argument, and stores the result in a variable called `result`.
10. The function then uses the `printf` function to print a message that includes the factorial of `num`.
11. The function then returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.</s>
