Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `<iostream>` header file, which provides input and output streams.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement brings the `std` namespace into the program, allowing the use of `cout` and other standard library functions without qualification.
3. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point for the program.
4. The `main` function initializes an integer variable `i` to 65, which is the ASCII value of the capital letter 'A'.
5. The program enters a loop that runs from 65 to 90, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, the program casts the integer `i` to a character using the `(char)i` expression, and then prints the character to the console using `cout`.
6. After the loop finishes, the program prints a newline character to the console using `cout`.
7. The program then enters a second loop that runs from 97 to 122, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, the program casts the integer `i` to a character using the `(char)i` expression, and then prints the character to the console using `cout`.
8. After the loop finishes, the program prints a newline character to the console using `cout`.
9. The `main` function returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

The control flow of the program is relatively simple, with two loops that iterate over the ASCII values of the capital and lowercase letters, respectively. The program uses the `cout` statement to print the characters to the console, and the `(char)i` expression to cast the integer `i` to a character.</s>
