You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  Sure, here's the control flow information for the program:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point for the program.
3. The `main` function initializes three variables: `A`, `B`, and `sum`.
4. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using the `printf` function.
5. The program reads the two numbers from the user using the `scanf` function.
6. The program calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator.
7. The program prints the sum using the `printf` function.
8. The program returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

Note that the control flow information only shows the high-level structure of the program, and does not include the specific values of variables or the exact sequence of operations.</s>
