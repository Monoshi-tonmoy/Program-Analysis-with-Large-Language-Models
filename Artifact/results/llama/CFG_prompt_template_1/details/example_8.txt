You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains functions for input and output.
2. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The `main` function initializes two integer variables, `l` and `b`, with the values 10 and 10, respectively.
4. The `main` function then uses the `printf` function to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle with the dimensions `l` and `b`.
5. The `main` function then returns 0, indicating that the program has completed successfully.

The control flow of the program is linear, with each statement executed in sequence. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, and then initializes the `l` and `<s>	` variables. The `main` function then uses the `printf` function to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle, and finally returns 0 to indicate that the program has completed successfully.</s>
