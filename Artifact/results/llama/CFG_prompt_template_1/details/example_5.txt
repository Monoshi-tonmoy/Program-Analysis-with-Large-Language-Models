Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines an array `arr1` of integers with 5 rows and 5 columns, and initializes each element with a value.
3. The program then defines an array `arr2` of pointers to integers with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4. The program then initializes each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`.
5. The program then prints the values in `arr2` using a nested loop.
6. The program then returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The control flow of the program can be represented as a flowchart:
