Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains functions for input and output.
2. The program then defines a function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer argument `N`.
3. Inside the `checkEvenOdd` function, the program calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`).
4. The program then checks if the remainder is equal to 0. If it is, the program prints the string "Even" using the `printf` function.
5. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the program prints the string "Odd" using the `printf` function.
6. The program then ends.

Note that the program only checks if the input number is even or odd, and does not perform any other operations.</s>
