You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains functions for input and output.
2. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The `main` function initializes two integer variables, `x` and `y`, with the values 15 and 25, respectively.
4. The `max` variable is initialized with the maximum of `x` and `y`.
5. The program enters a while loop, which will continue until the `max` variable is divisible by both `x` and `y`.
6. Inside the while loop, the program checks if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y` using the modulo operator (`%`).
7. If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints a message to the console and exits the loop using the `break` statement.
8. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by 1 and repeats the loop.
9. The program returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The control flow of the program is a simple loop that checks if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, and if it is, it prints a message to the console and exits the loop. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by 1 and repe<s>
