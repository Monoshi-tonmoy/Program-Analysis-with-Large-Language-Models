Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program then defines two global variables, `prev1` and `prev2`, which are used to store the previous two values in the Fibonacci series.
3. The program then defines a recursive function, `fib`, which takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series. The function first checks if `n` is less than 3, and if so, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number using the previous two values, and then updates the previous two values. The function then prints the `n`th Fibonacci number and calls itself recursively with `n - 1` as the input.
4. The program then defines a function, `printFib`, which takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series. The function first checks if `n` is less than 1, and if so, it prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, it checks if `n` is 1 or 2, and if so, it prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series and returns. Otherwise, it prints the first two terms of the Fibonacci series and then calls the `fib` function with `n - 2` as the input.
5. The program then defines the `main` function, which takes no input and returns an integer. The `main` function first sets the value of `n` to 9 and then calls the `printFib` function with `n` as the input. The `main` function then returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

Overall, the control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file.
2. The program then defines the `fib` and `printFib` functions.
3. The program then defines the `main` function, which calls the `printFib` function with `n` as the input.
4. The `printFib` function first checks if `n` is less than 1
