Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    while(i < len) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
        i++;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return i;
}

int tx_int(char *ptr) {
    int val = OBJ_SIZE;
    while(val < OBJ_SIZE) {
        send_msg(ptr, 16);
    }
    free(ptr);
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which are variables that hold memory addresses. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `ptr` in `send_msg`: This is a pointer to a character array that is passed as an argument to the function. The function uses this pointer to write data to the buffer.
2. `ptr` in `tx_int`: This is a pointer to a character array that is passed as an argument to the function. The function uses this pointer to write data to the buffer.
3. `buf_write_msg`: This is a pointer to a function that writes data to a buffer. The function takes a pointer to a character array as an argument and writes the data to the buffer.
4. `free`: This is a pointer to a function that frees memory allocated on the heap. The function takes a pointer to a memory block as an argument and frees the memory.

The code uses pointers to pass data between functions and to manage memory. The `send_msg` function takes a pointer to a character array as an argument and writes data to the buffer using the `buf_write_msg` function. The `tx_int` function takes a pointer to a character array as an argument and writes data to the buffer using the `send_msg` function. The `free` function is used to free memory allocated on the heap.

Overall, the code uses pointers effectively to manage memory and pass data between functions.</s>
