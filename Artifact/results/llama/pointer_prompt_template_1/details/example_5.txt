Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun6(int *d) {
    int val = *d;
    val += 10;
    return val;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided is a function called `fun6` that takes a pointer to an integer as an argument. The function dereferences the pointer and assign<s>
s the value of the integer to a local variable called `val`. The function then adds 10 to the value of `val` and returns it.

Here are the pointers in the code:

1. `int *d`: This is a pointer to an integer. It is the argument of the function `fun6`.
2. `int val`: This is a local variable of type integer. It is initialized with the value of the integer that `d` points to.
3. `*d`: This is a dereference of the pointer `d`. It is used to access the value of the integer that `d` points to.
4. `val += 10`: This is an assignment statement that adds 10 to the value of `val`.

The function `fun6` takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and returns the value of the integer plus 10.</s>
