Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int bar() { int a = 12, b = 24; int *sum = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); *sum = a + b; printf("%d\n", *sum); printf("%d\n", *sum); return 0; }
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers:

1. `int *sum`: This is a pointer to an integer. It is declared using the `*` operator, which indicates that it is a pointer. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for the integer, and the address of the allocated memory is stored in the `sum` pointer.
2. `a` and `b`: These are integer variables that are declared and initialized to the values 12 and 2<s>	4, respectively.
3. `*sum`: This is a dereferenced pointer to an integer. It is used to access the value stored in the memory location pointed to by the `sum` pointer. The `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer, which means that the value stored in the memory location is returned, rather than the address of the memory location.
4. `printf("%d\n", *sum)`: This is a call to the `printf` function, which is used to print the value stored in the `sum` pointer. The `%d` format specifier is used to indicate that the value should be printed as a signed integer. The `*sum` expression is used to dereference the `sum` pointer and retrieve the value stored in the memory location.
5. `return 0`: This is a return statement that is used to return the value 0 from the `bar` function.

Overall, the code you provided is using pointers to allocate memory for an integer and to store the result of an arithmetic operation in that memory location. The `printf` function is then used to print the value stored in the memory location.</s>
