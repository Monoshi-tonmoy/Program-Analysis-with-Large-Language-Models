Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
board_square_t *make_board() {
    #define MAX_DIM 100
    int m,n, error;
    board_square_t *board;
    printf("Please specify the board height: \n");
    error = scanf("%d", &m);
    if ( EOF == error ){
        die("No integer passed: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    printf("Please specify the board width: \n");
    error = scanf("%d", &n);
    if ( EOF == error ){
        die("No integer passed: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    if ( m > MAX_DIM || n > MAX_DIM ) {
        die("Value too large: Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    board = (board_square_t*) malloc( m * n * sizeof(board_square_t));
    return board;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided is a function called `make_board` that creates a 2D array of `board_square_t` structures. The function takes no arguments and returns a pointer to the 2D array.

Here are the pointers in the code:

1. `board_square_t *board`: This is a pointer to the 2D array of `board_square_t` structures. It is declared as a local variable in the function and is initialized to `NULL`.
2. `board = (board_square_t*) malloc( m * n * sizeof(board_square_t));`: This is a call to the `malloc` function, which allocates memory for the 2D array. The `board` pointer is assigned the address of the allocated memory.
3. `return board`: This is a return statement that returns the address of the 2D array to the caller.

The code also uses the `scanf` function to read input from the user and the `die` function to exit the program if the input is invalid.</s>
