Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int pure_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
   const unsigned char *b1 = (const unsigned char *) b1_;
   const unsigned char *b2 = (const unsigned char *) b2_;
   size_t i;
   unsigned char d = (unsigned char) 0 U;
   for (i = 0 U; i < len; i++) {
        d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
   }
   return (int)((1 &((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1);
}

int pure_strcmp(const char *const s1, const char *const s2) {
    return pure_memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(s1) + 1 U);
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which are denoted by the `*` symbol. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `b1_` and `b2_`: These are pointers to the first and second arguments of the `pure_memcmp` function, respectively. They are declared as `const void *const` pointers, which means they are constant pointers to constant data.
2. `b1` and `b2`: These are pointers to the first and second arguments of the `pure_memcmp` function, respectively. They are declared as `const unsigned char *` pointers, which means they are constant pointers to unsigned characters.
3. `i`: This is a pointer to the `size_t` variable `len`, which is the length of the memory block being compared.
4. `d`: This is a pointer to the `unsigned char` variable `d`, which is used to store the result of the comparison.
5. `s1` and `s2`: These are pointers to the first and second arguments of the `pure_strcmp` function, respectively. They are declared as `const char *const` pointers, which means they are constant pointers to constant strings.

The pointers in the code are used to pass data between functions and to access memory locations. The `const` qualifier is used to indicate that the data being pointed to should not be modified. The `*` symbol is used to dereference the pointers and access the data they point to.</s>
