Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which are variables that hold memory addresses as their values. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `intptr`: This is a pointer to an integer variable. It is declared as `int *intptr = &num;`, where `num` is an integer variable with the value 10. The `&` operator is used to get the address of `num`, and the result is stored in `intptr`.
2. `floatptr`: This is a pointer to a floating-point variable. It is declared as `float *floatptr = (float *)&num;`, where `num` is an integer variable with the value 10. The `(float *)` cast is used to convert the address of `num` to a pointer to a floating-point variable. The result is stored in `floatptr`.
3. `*floatptr`: This is a dereference of the `floatptr` pointer. It is used to access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by `floatptr`. In this case, the value stored at `floatptr` is 20.5, which is a floating-point value.

In summary, the code you provided contains two pointers: `intptr` and `floatptr`. `intptr` is a pointer to an integer variable, while `floatptr` is a pointer to a floating-point variable. The code also dereferences `floatptr` to access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by `floatptr`.</s>
