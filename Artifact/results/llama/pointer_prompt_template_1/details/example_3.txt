Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun4() {
    int *ptr = NULL;
    int value;
    value = *ptr;
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which are variables that hold memory addresses. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `int *ptr = NULL;`: This line declares a pointer variable called `ptr` and initializes it to `NULL`. The `*` symbol before the variable name indicates that it is a pointer.
2. `int value;`: This line declares a variable called `value` of type `int`.
3. `value = *ptr;`: This line assigns the value stored in the memory location pointed to by `ptr` to `value`. The `*` symbol before `ptr` is called the "dereference" operator, and it is used to access the value stored in the memory location pointed to by the pointer.

In summary, the code declares a pointer variable `ptr` and initializes it to `NULL`. It then declares a variable `value` of type `int` and assigns the value stored in the memory location pointed to by `ptr` to `value`.</s>
