Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int size(struct node* head) {
    struct node* current = head;
    struct node* tail;
    while (current != NULL) {
        tail = current;
        current = current->next;
        }
    return tail - head;
}

The code you provided is a function that calculates the size of a linked list. The function takes a pointer to the head of the list as an argument and returns the size of the list.

Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `struct node* head`: This is a pointer to the head of the linked list. It is the starting point of the list and is used to traverse the list.
2. `struct node* current`: This is a pointer to the current node in the list. It is used to iterate through the list and is updated in the while loop.
3. `struct node* tail`: This is a pointer to the tail of the linked list. It is used to keep track of the last node in the list and is updated in the while loop.
4. `current->next`: This is a pointer to the next node in the list. It is used to traverse the list and is updated in the while loop.

The function works by iterating through the list using the `current` pointer and updating the `tail` pointer to point to the last node in the list. The size of the list is then calculated by subtracting the address of the head node from the address of the tail node.

It's worth noting that this function assumes that the list is not empty and that the head node is not null. If the list is empty or the head node is null, the function will return a size of 0.</s>
