Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
typedef struct elem_list {
    int val;
    struct elem_list *next;
} Elements;

int elem_member(int val, Elements *c) {
    Elements *elem;
    for(elem == c; c != NULL; elem = elem->next) {
        if(elem->val == val) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The code defines a struct `elem_list` with two members: `val` and `next`. The `next` member is a pointer to another `elem_list` struct, which allows for a linked list of `elem_list` structs.

The function `elem_member` takes two arguments: `val` and `c`. It checks if the value `val` is a member of the linked list of `elem_list` structs pointed to by `c`. If it is, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

The function uses a loop to iterate over the linked list of `elem_list` structs. It starts at the `c` pointer and follows the `next` pointers until it reaches the end of the list. For each `elem_list` struct, it checks if the `val` member is equal to the `val` argument. If it is, the function returns 1. If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, the function returns 0.

The function uses the `elem` pointer to keep track of the current `elem_list` struct in the loop. It is initialized to `c` and then updated to `elem->next` in each iteration of the loop. This allows the function to follow the linked list of `elem_list` structs.

The function also uses the `val` member of the `elem_list` struct to check if the value `val` is a member of the linked list. It is compared to the `val` argument using the `==` operator. If the values are equal, the function returns 1.

In summary, the function `elem_member` checks if a value is a member of a linked list of `elem_list` structs. It uses a loop to iterate over the linked list and checks if the value is equal to the `val` member of each `elem_list` struct. If it is, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.</s>
