Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
struct Ex {
    int field;
};

int fun5(struct Ex *d) {
    int val;
    if (d->field) 
        val = 1;

    if (d->field)
        val = 2;
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which are denoted by the `*` symbol. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `struct Ex *d`: This is a pointer to a `struct Ex` object. The `*` symbol indicates that `d` is a pointer, and it points to a `struct Ex` object.
2. `int field`: This is a field of the `struct Ex` object that `d` points to. It is an integer field, and it is accessed using the `->` operator.
3. `int val`: This is a local variable declared in the `fun5` function. It is an integer variable, and it is initialized to 0.
4. `if (d->field)`: This is a conditional statement that checks the value of the `field` field in the `struct Ex` object that `d` points to. If the value of `field` is non-zero, the statement is considered true, and the code inside the `if` block is executed.
5. `val = 1`: This is an assignment statement that assigns the value 1 to the `val` variable. It is executed if the `if` statement is true.
6. `if (d->field)`: This is another conditional statement that checks the value of the `field` field in the `struct Ex` object that `d` points to. If the value of `field` is non-zero, the statement is considered true, and the code inside the `if` block is executed.
7. `val = 2`: This is an assignment statement that assigns the value 2 to the `val` variable. It is executed if the `if` statement is true.

In summary, the code you provided contains several pointers, including `d`, which points to a `struct Ex` object, and `val`, which is a local variable declared in the `fun5` function. The code also contains several conditional statements that check the value of the `field` field in the `struct Ex` object that `d` points to, and assigns values to the `val` variable based on the result of those checks.</s>
