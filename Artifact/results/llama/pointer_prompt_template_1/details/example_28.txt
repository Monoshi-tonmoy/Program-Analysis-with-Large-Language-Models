Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)

int contains_char(char c){
    char *str;
    str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
    while( *str != NULL){
        if( *str == c ){
            /* matched char, free string and return success */
            free(str);
            return SUCCESS;
        }
        /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
        str = str + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */

    free(str);
    return FAILURE;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which I will now analyze:

1. `char *str`: This is a pointer to a character array that is dynamically allocated using `malloc`. The pointer is used to store the string "Search Me!" and is later freed using `free`.
2. `*str`: This is a dereferenced pointer to the first character of the string. It is used to check if the character is NULL, which indicates the end of the string.
3. `str + 1`: This is a pointer to the next character in the string. It is used to iterate through the string and check if the character matches the input character `c`.
4. `free(str)`: This is a call to the `free` function, which is used to deallocate the memory allocated by `malloc`. It is called twice in the code, once to free the string and once to free the pointer `str`.

Overall, the code is using pointers to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for the string and to iterate through the characters in the string. The pointers are used to check if the input character `c` is present in the string and to return a success or failure code depending on the result.</s>
