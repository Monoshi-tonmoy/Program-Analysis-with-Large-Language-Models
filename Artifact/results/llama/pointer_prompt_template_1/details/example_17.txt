Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int *fun(){  
    int y=10;  
    return &y;  
}  
int main()  
{  
    int *p=fun();  
    printf("%d", *p);  
    return 0;  
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided is a C program that demonstrates the use of pointers in C. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `fun` function is defined to return a pointer to an integer. The function creates a local variable `y` and initializes it to the value 10. The function then returns the address of `y` using the `&` operator.
2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `fun` function and assigns the returned pointer to a variable `p` of type `int *`.
3. The `printf` function is used to print the value of the integer pointed to by `p`. The `%d` format specifier is used to print an integer value.
4. The `return 0` statement is used to return an integer value (0) from the `main` function.

Now, let's analyze the pointers in the code:

1. The `fun` function returns a pointer to an integer. The pointer is created using the `&` operator, which returns the address of the variable `y`.
2. The `main` function assigns the returned pointer to a variable `p` of type `int *`. This means that `p` is a pointer to an integer.
3. The `printf` function is used to print the value of the integer pointed to by `p`. The `%d` format specifier is used to print an integer value.

In summary, the code demonstrates the use of pointers in C to return a pointer to a local variable from a function and to print the value of the integer pointed to by the pointer.</s>
