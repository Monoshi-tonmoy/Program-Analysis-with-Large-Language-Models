Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
    char *retMessage;
    char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));

    // copy input string to a temporary string
    char message[length+1];
    int index;
    for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        message[index] = strMessage[index];
    }
    message[index] = '\0';

    // trim trailing whitespace
    int len = index-1;
    while (isspace(message[len])) {
        message[len] = '\0';
        len--;
    }

    // return string without trailing whitespace
    retMessage = message;
    return retMessage;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided is a function that takes a string and its length as input, and returns a new string without trailing whitespace. Here's a breakdown of the pointers in the code:

1. `char *strMessage`: This is a pointer to a string that is passed as an argument to the function. The function uses this pointer to access the string and manipulate it.
2. `char *retMessage`: This is a pointer to a string that is returned by the function. The function allocates memory for this string using `malloc`, and then copies the modified string into it.
3. `char *message`: This is a pointer to a temporary string that is used to store the input string while it is being modified. The function allocates memory for this string using `malloc`, and then copies the input string into it.
4. `char message[length+1]`: This is an array of characters that is used to store the input string while it is being modified. The function uses this array to store the input string, and then copies it into the `retMessage` string.
5. `int index`: This is a variable that is used to keep track of the current position in the input string. The function uses this variable to iterate over the input string and modify it.
6. `int len`: This is a variable that is used to keep track of the length of the input string. The function uses this variable to determine when it has reached the end of the input string.

Overall, the code uses pointers to manipulate the input string and return a new string without trailing whitespace. The use of pointers allows the function to modify the input string in place, without making a copy of it.</s>
