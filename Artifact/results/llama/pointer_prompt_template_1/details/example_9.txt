Analyze the pointers in the following code.
```
int fun10() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    int val = 50;
    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        *ptr = val * i;
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The code you provided contains several pointers, which I will now analyze:

1. `int *ptr`: This is a pointer to an integer. It is declared using the `int *` syntax, which indicates that `ptr` is a pointer to an integer. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for the integer, and the address of the allocated memory is stored in `ptr`.
2. `int val`: This is an integer variable that is declared and initialized to the value 50.
3. `for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++)`: This is a `for` loop that iterates 25 times. The loop variable `i` is declared and initialized to 0, and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
4. `*ptr = val * i`: This is an assignment statement that assigns the value of `val * i` to the memory location pointed to by `ptr`. The `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer `ptr`, which means that the value stored in the memory location pointed to by `ptr` is modified.
5. `free(ptr)`: This is a call to the `free` function, which deallocates the memory block pointed to by `ptr`. The `free` function is called at the end of each iteration of the `for` loop, which means that the memory block is deallocated and reallocated for each iteration.

Overall, the code you provided is using pointers to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for an integer variable. The `for` loop is used to iterate 25 times, and each time the value of `val * i` is assigned to the memory location pointed to by `ptr`. The `free` function is called at the end of each iteration to deallocate the memory block pointed to by `ptr`.</s>
