''' [/INST]  The code snippet you provided contains several issues that can be identified as potential security vulnerabilities or coding errors. Here's a breakdown of the issues in the code:

1. Bad pointer arithmetic:
In the `contains_char` function, the pointer `str` is incremented by 1 in the while loop. However, the pointer is not checked for NULL before the increment, which can lead to a null pointer dereference. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
2. Unsafe dereferencing:
In the `contains_char` function, the `str` pointer is dereferenced without checking for NULL. This can lead to a null pointer dereference, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
3. Buffer overflow or buffer underwrite:
In the `contains_char` function, the `str` pointer is assigned to a memory block allocated using `malloc`. However, the memory block is not checked for NULL before the assignment, which can lead to a buffer overflow or buffer underwrite.
4. Bad allocation / deallocation:
In the `contains_char` function, the `str` pointer is allocated using `malloc`, but it is not checked for NULL before the allocation. This can lead to a buffer overflow or buffer underwrite. Additionally, the `free` function is called on the `str` pointer without checking for NULL, which can also lead to a buffer overflow or buffer underwrite.
5. Improper sanitization of input:
In the `contains_char` function, the `c` parameter is not sanitized before being used in the `strcpy` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow or buffer underwrite if the `c` parameter contains a malicious input.

To fix these issues, the code can be modified as follows:

1. Check for NULL before incrementing the pointer:

```c
while( *str != NULL){
    if( *str == c ){
        /* matched char, free string and return success */
        free(str);
        return SUCCESS;
    }
    /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
    str = str + 1;
}
```

2. Check for NULL before dereferencing the pointer:

```c
if( *str == c ){
    /* matched char, free string
