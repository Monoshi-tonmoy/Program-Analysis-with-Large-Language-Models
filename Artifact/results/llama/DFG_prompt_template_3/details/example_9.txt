You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `i` and initializing it to 65, which is the ASCII value of the capital letter 'A'.
2. The program then enters a loop that runs 26 times, with `i` being incremented by 1 each time.
3. Inside the loop, the program uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console. The `(char)i` expression is used to convert the integer value of `i` to its corresponding character value.
4. After the loop finishes, the program prints a newline character and then enters another loop that runs 26 times, with `i` being incremented by 1 each time.
5. Inside the second loop, the program again uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console. However, this time the character values are in the range of 97 to 122, which corresponds to the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.
6. After the second loop finishes, the program returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

In summary, the dataflow in the program is as follows:

* The program starts by initializing an integer variable `i` to 65.
* The program then enters a loop that runs 26 times, with `i` being incremented by 1 each time. Inside the loop, the program uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console.
* After the loop finishes, the program prints a newline character and then enters another loop that runs 26 times, with `i` being incremented by 1 each time. Inside the second loop, the program again uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console.
* After the second loop finishes, the program returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.</s>
