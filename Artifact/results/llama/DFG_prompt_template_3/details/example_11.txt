You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring variables `ch`, `a`, and `b` of type `char`, `double`, and `double`, respectively.
2. The program then enters a `while` loop that runs indefinitely until the user enters the character 'x' to exit the program.
3. Inside the `while` loop, the program prompts the user to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `x`) and two operands (`a` and `b`).
4. The program then uses a `switch` statement to determine the operation to be performed based on the operator entered by the user.
5. If the operator is `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`, the program performs the corresponding operation on the operands `a` and `b` and prints the result.
6. If the operator is `x`, the program exits the `while` loop and terminates.
7. If the operator is invalid, the program prints an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid operator.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:
```
