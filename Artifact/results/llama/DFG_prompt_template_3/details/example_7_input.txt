Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n// C program to implement \n// the above approach \n#include <stdio.h> \n\n// Driver code \nint main() \n{ \n\t// We can change values here for \n\t// different inputs \n\tfloat P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; \n\n\t// Calculate simple interest \n\tfloat SI = (P * T * R) / 100; \n\n\t// Print Simple Interest \n\tprintf(\"Simple Interest = %f\\n\", SI); \n\n\treturn 0; \n}\n```"}]
