You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by reading an integer N from the user.
2. The program then calculates the remainder of N divided by 2 using the modulo operator (%).
3. The program then checks if the remainder is equal to 0. If it is, the program prints "Even" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "Odd".
4. The program then ends.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:

In this dataflow diagram, the boxes represent the different parts of the program, and the arrows represent the flow of data between them. The program starts with the user inputting an integer N, which is then read by the program and stored in the variable N. The program then calculates the remainder of N divided by 2 using the modulo operator (%). The program then
