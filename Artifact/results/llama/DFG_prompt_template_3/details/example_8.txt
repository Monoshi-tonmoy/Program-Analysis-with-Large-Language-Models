You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring two integer variables, `l` and `b`, and initializing them to 10.
2. The program then calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b`. The result is stored in a temporary variable.
3. The program then calculates the perimeter of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and adding 2 to the result. The result is stored in a temporary variable.
4. The program then prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the `printf` function.
5. The program ends by returning 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

Here is the dataflow diagram for the program:
