You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining three variables: P, R, and T. These variables are used to store the principal, rate, and time, respectively.
2. The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100.
3. The calculated simple interest is then printed to the console using the printf() function.
4. The program ends by returning 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

Overall, the dataflow in this program is relatively simple, with the program starting by defining the input variables and then calculating the simple interest using those variables. The calculated simple interest is then printed to the console before the program ends.</s>
