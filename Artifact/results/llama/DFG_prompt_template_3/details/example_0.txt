You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `number`.
2. The program then uses the `printf` function to display a message asking the user to enter an integer.
3. The program then uses the `scanf` function to read the user's input and store it in the `number` variable.
4. The program then uses the `printf` function to display the user's input, along with a message indicating that the input has been received.
5. The program then returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:
```
