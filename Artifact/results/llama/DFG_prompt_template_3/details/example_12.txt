You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining a function called `print_table` that takes two integer arguments, `range` and `num`.
2. The function declares a local variable called `mul` and initializes it to 0.
3. The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to `range`.
4. Inside the loop, the function multiplies `num` by the current value of `i` and stores the result in `mul`.
5. The function then prints the value of `mul` using `printf`.
6. The function then prints a newline character using `printf`.
7. The function then increments `i` by 1 and repeats the loop until `i` is greater than `range`.
8. After the loop exits, the function returns 0.
9. The main function then calls the `print_table` function with the arguments `range` and `num`.
10. The program then exits with a return value of 0.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:
```
