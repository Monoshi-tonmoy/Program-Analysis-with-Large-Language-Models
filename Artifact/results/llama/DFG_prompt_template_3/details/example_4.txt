You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining a 3x3 matrix of integers, with each element initialized to a specific value.
2. The program then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function, which swaps the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix.
3. The `interchangeFirstLast` function first initializes a temporary variable `t` to the value of the first element of the first row.
4. The function then assigns the value of the last element of the last row to the first element of the first row.
5. The function then assigns the value of the temporary variable `t` to the last element of the last row.
6. The function then repeats steps 3-5 for each element of the first and last rows, effectively swapping the elements of the two rows.
7. The program then prints the original matrix and the modified matrix to the console.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:

Input Matrix:

| 6 | 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 5 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 | 9 |

Output Matrix:

| 2 | 4 | 9 |
| 4 | 5 | 2 |
| 6 | 3 | 1 |

In this dataflow, the input matrix is first initialized with specific values, and then passed to the `interchangeFirstLast` function. The function modifies the matrix by swapping the elements of the first and last rows, and then the modified matrix is printed to the console.</s>
