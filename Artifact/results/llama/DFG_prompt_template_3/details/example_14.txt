You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring and initializing three variables: `x`, `y`, and `max`.
2. The program then checks if `x` is greater than `y` using the ternary operator. If `x` is greater than `y`, the program sets `max` to `x`. Otherwise, it sets `max` to `y`.
3. The program then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely.
4. Inside the while loop, the program checks if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y` using the modulo operator. If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints a message to the console and breaks out of the while loop.
5. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by 1 and repeats the while loop.
6. The program then exits the while loop and returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:
