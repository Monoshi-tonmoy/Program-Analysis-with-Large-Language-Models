You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Java program.
-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that sorts an array of integers. Analyze the dataflow to identify how the elements are manipulated during the sorting process.


Now, based on the given information, please share the dataflow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow in the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining two global variables `prev1` and `prev2` to store the previous two values of the Fibonacci series.
2. The `fib` function is called with an integer argument `n`, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci series to be printed.
3. The `fib` function first checks if `n` is less than 3, and if so, it returns without printing anything.
4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the next Fibonacci number `fn` using the previous two values `prev1` and `prev2`.
5. The function then updates the previous two values `prev1` and `prev2` to the current values `fn` and `prev1`, respectively.
6. The function then prints the current Fibonacci number `fn` and recursively calls itself with the argument `n - 1`.
7. The `printFib` function is called with an integer argument `n`, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci series to be printed.
8. The `printFib` function first checks if `n` is less than 1, and if so, it prints an error message and returns.
9. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the function calls the `fib` function with the argument `n`.
10. The `fib` function then prints the Fibonacci series using the recursive approach.
11. The `main` function is called with an integer argument `n`, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci series to be printed.
12. The `main` function calls the `printFib` function with the argument `n`.
13. The `printFib` function then prints the Fibonacci series using the recursive approach.

The dataflow in the program can be represented as follows:
```
