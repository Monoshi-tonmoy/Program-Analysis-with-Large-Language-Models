You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining a 3x3 matrix of integers, `m`, and initializing it with the values 6, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 2, 4, 9.
2. The program then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function, which swaps the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix.
3. The `interchangeFirstLast` function first initializes a variable, `rows`, to the number of rows in the matrix, which is 3.
4. The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix. For each element, the function swaps the values of the element in the first row with the value of the corresponding element in the last row.
5. After the loop completes, the program prints the original matrix and the modified matrix to the console.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* The decision to call the `interchangeFirstLast` function.
* The decision to swap the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix.

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* The loop that iterates over the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix in the `interchangeFirstLast` function.</s>
