You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The program asks the user to enter two numbers, A and B, using the `printf` function.
4. The program reads the two numbers from the user using the `scanf` function.
5. The program calculates the sum of A and B using the `+` operator.
6. The program prints the sum using the `printf` function.
7. The program returns 0 to indicate successful termination.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* The `if` statement in the `main` function, which checks whether the user has entered two numbers.
* The `while` loop in the `main` function, which repe<s>

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* The `while` loop in the `main` function, which repeats the calculation of the sum until the user enters two numbers.</s>
