You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers. Here's the control flow analysis of the program:

1. The program starts with the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The main function declares three variables: x, y, and max.
3. The program then checks if x is greater than y using the ternary operator. If x is greater than y, the program sets max to x. Otherwise, it sets max to y.
4. The program then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
5. Inside the while loop, the program checks if max is divisible by both x and y using the modulo operator (%). If max is divisible by both x and y, the program prints a message to the console and breaks out of the loop.
6. If max is not divisible by both x and y, the program increments max by 1 and repeats the loop.
7. The program then exits the main function and terminates.

The decision points in the program are:

* The ternary operator in line 3, which checks if x is greater than y.
* The while loop in line 5, which checks if max is divisible by both x and y.

The loops in the program are:

* The while loop in line 5, which runs indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.</s>
