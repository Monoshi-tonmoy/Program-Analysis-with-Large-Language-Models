You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts execution at the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The `main` method declares an integer variable `num` and initializes it to 5.
3. The `main` method then calls the `factorial` method, passing `num` as an argument.
4. The `factorial` method declares an integer variable `result` and initializes it to 1.
5. The `factorial` method then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `num`.
6. Inside the loop, the `result` variable is multiplied by the current value of `i`.
7. After the loop, the `result` variable is returned as the factorial of `num`.
8. The `main` method then prints the result of the `factorial` method to the console.
9. The program ends execution at the end of the `main` method.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* The `main` method decides whether to call the `factorial` method or not.
* The `factorial` method decides whether to enter the loop or not.

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* The loop in the `factorial` method that iterates from 2 to `num`.</s>
