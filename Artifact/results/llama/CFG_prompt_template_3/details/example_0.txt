You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `number`.
2. The program then uses the `printf` function to display a message asking the user to enter an integer.
3. The program then uses the `scanf` function to read the user's input and store it in the `number` variable.
4. The program then uses the `printf` function to display a message indicating the user's input.
5. The program then returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

There are no decision points or loops in the control flow of this program. The program simply executes in a linear fashion, with each statement following the previous one in a straight line.</s>
