Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by identifying the decision points and loops.

Decision Points:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input and output functions.
2. The program then defines a function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer argument `N`.
3. Inside the function, the program calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator `%`.
4. The program then checks if the remainder is equal to 0, which indicates that the number is even.
5. If the remainder is 0, the program prints "Even" using the `printf` function.
6. If the remainder is not 0, the program prints "Odd" using the `printf` function.

Loops:

1. The program does not contain any loops.

Based on the given information, the control flow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
