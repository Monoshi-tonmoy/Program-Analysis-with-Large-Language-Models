You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts execution at the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The `main` method calls the `printFib` method with the argument `n`, which is the number of terms to print in the Fibonacci series.
3. The `printFib` method checks the value of `n` and handles the first two terms separately. If `n` is less than 1, it prints an error message and returns. If `n` is 1, it prints the first term (0) and returns. If `n` is 2, it prints the first two terms (0 and 1) and returns.
4. If `n` is greater than 2, the `printFib` method calls the `fib` method with the argument `n - 1`. The `fib` method calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number and prints it. It then calls itself recursively with the argument `n - 1` until the base case is reached, which is when `n` is less than 3.
5. The `fib` method returns the calculated Fibonacci number to the `printFib` method, which prints it and returns.
6. The `main` method returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* In the `main` method:
	+ If `n` is less than 1, print an error message and return.
	+ If `n` is 1, print the first term (0) and return.
	+ If `n` is 2, print the first two terms (0 and 1) and return.
	+ If `n` is greater than 2, call the `fib` method with the argument `n - 1`.
* In the `fib` method:
	+ If `n` is less than 3, return.
	+ If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number and print it.

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* In the `fib` method:
	+ The method calls itself recursively with
