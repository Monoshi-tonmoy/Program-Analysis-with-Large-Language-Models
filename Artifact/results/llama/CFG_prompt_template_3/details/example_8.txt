You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts execution at the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.
2. The `main` method declares two integer variables, `l` and `b`, and initializes them to 10.
3. The `main` method then calls the `printf` function twice, once to print the area of the rectangle and once to print the perimeter of the rectangle.
4. The `printf` function takes two arguments: a format string and a variable number of arguments. The format string is a string that specifies how the arguments should be formatted, and the arguments are the values that should be formatted.
5. The `printf` function returns an integer value indicating the number of characters written to the console.
6. The `main` method then returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the program.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* The decision to call the `printf` function twice, once to print the area of the rectangle and once to print the perimeter of the rectangle.
* The decision to return an integer value indicating the success or failure of the program.

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* The `main` method is the only loop in the program, and it executes once when the program is run.

The control flow of the program can be represented as a flowchart, as follows:
