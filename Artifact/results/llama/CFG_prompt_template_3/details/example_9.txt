You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring an integer variable `i` and initializing it to 65, which is the ASCII value of the capital letter 'A'.
2. The program then enters a loop that runs until `i` is greater than or equal to 90, which is the ASCII value of the capital letter 'Z'.
3. Inside the loop, the program uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console. This is done by casting `i` to a `char` type using the `(char)i` syntax.
4. After the loop finishes, the program prints a newline character to the console using the `cout` statement.
5. The program then enters a second loop that runs until `i` is greater than or equal to 122, which is the ASCII value of the lowercase letter 'z'.
6. Inside the loop, the program uses the `cout` statement to print the character equivalent of `i` to the console. This is done by casting `i` to a `char` type using the `(char)i` syntax.
7. After the loop finishes, the program returns a value of 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

The decision points in the program are the conditions in the loops that determine when the loops should terminate. The loops themselves are the loops in the program that execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

The control flow of the program can be represented graphically as follows:
