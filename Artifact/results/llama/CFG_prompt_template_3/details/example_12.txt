You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by defining a function called `print_table` that takes two integer arguments, `range` and `num`.
2. The function then declares a variable called `mul` and initializes it to 0.
3. The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to `range`.
4. Inside the `for` loop, the function multiplies `num` by the current value of `i` and stores the result in `mul`.
5. The function then prints the string "Multiplication table of " followed by the value of `num` and the current value of `i`, followed by the string " = " and the value of `mul`.
6. The function then prints a newline character using the `printf` function.
7. The function then increments the value of `i` by 1 and repe<s>
