You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Java program.
-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that calculates the average of an array of integers. Analyze the control flow to identify key decision points and loops.


Now, based on the given information, please share the control flow details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the given Java program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the necessary libraries: `math.h`, `stdio.h`, and `stdlib.h`.
2. The `findRoots` function is defined, which takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The function first checks if `a` is 0, in which case the equation is not quadratic and the function returns "Invalid".
4. If `a` is not 0, the function calculates the discriminant `d` using the formula `b*b - 4*a*c`.
5. The function then checks the value of `d`:
	* If `d` is positive, the roots of the equation are real and different. The function prints "Roots are real and different" and then calculates the roots using the formula `-b ± sqrt(d) / (2*a)`.
	* If `d` is 0, the roots of the equation are real and the same. The function prints "Roots are real and same" and then calculates the root using the formula `-b / (2*a)`.
	* If `d` is negative, the roots of the equation are complex. The function prints "Roots are complex" and then calculates the roots using the formula `-b ± i*sqrt(d) / (2*a)`, where `i` is the imaginary unit.
6. The `main` function is defined, which sets the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and then calls the `findRoots` function with these values.
7. The program ends.

In summary, the control flow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
