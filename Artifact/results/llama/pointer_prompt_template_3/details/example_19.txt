The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int pure_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
   const unsigned char *b1 = (const unsigned char *) b1_;
   const unsigned char *b2 = (const unsigned char *) b2_;
   size_t i;
   unsigned char d = (unsigned char) 0 U;
   for (i = 0 U; i < len; i++) {
        d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
   }
   return (int)((1 &((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1);
}

int pure_strcmp(const char *const s1, const char *const s2) {
    return pure_memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(s1) + 1 U);
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided contains several potential security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse. Here are some of the issues I identified:

1. The `pure_memcmp` function takes three arguments: `b1_`, `b2_`, and `len`. However, the function does not check the validity of the `b1_` and `b2_` pointers before using them. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory-related security vulnerabilities if the pointers are not valid.
2. The `pure_memcmp` function uses a loop to compare the contents of the two buffers. However, the loop does not check for the end of the buffers, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffers are not the same size.
3. The `pure_strcmp` function takes two arguments: `s1` and `s2`. However, the function does not check the validity of the `s1` and `s2` pointers before using them. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory-related security vulnerabilities if the pointers are not valid.
4. The `pure_strcmp` function uses the `strlen` function to get the length of the `s1` string. However, the `strlen` function does not check for the end of the string, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the string is not null-terminated.
5. The `pure_strcmp` function uses the `pure_memcmp` function to compare the contents of the two strings. However, the `pure_memcmp` function does not check for the end of the buffers, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the strings are not the same size.

To fix these issues, you should add checks for the validity of the pointers and the end of the buffers before using them. You should also use the `strnlen` function instead of `strlen` to get the length of the string, as it checks for the end of the string and returns the correct length even if the string is not null-terminated.

Here is an example of how you could fix the `pure_memcmp` function:
```
int pure_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
    const unsigned char *
