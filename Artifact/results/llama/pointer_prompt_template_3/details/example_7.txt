The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided contains a potential memory leak. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for an integer, and the pointer `ptr` is assigned to point to that memory. The integer value 15 is then stored in the memory location pointed to by `ptr`.

However, the `ptr` pointer is then set to `NULL` before the function returns. This means that the memory allocated by `malloc` is no longer accessible, and the program has lost the reference to that memory. This is a memory leak, as the memory is no longer being used by the program, but it is still allocated and cannot be reused.

To fix this issue, you should free the memory allocated by `malloc` before setting the `ptr` pointer to `NULL`. You can do this by adding a call to `free(ptr)` before the `ptr = NULL` statement.

Here is the corrected code:
```
int fun8() {   
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 15;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    return 0;
}
```
By freeing the memory allocated by `malloc` before setting the `ptr` pointer to `NULL`, you ensure that the memory is properly released and can be reused by the program.</s>
