The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int size(struct node* head) {
    struct node* current = head;
    struct node* tail;
    while (current != NULL) {
        tail = current;
        current = current->next;
        }
    return tail - head;
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided is a function that calcul<s>

The code you provided is a function that calculates the size of a linked list. The function takes a pointer to the head of the list as an argument and returns the size of the list.

The function first initializes two pointers, `current` and `tail`, to the head of the list. It then iterates through the list using the `current` pointer, and updates the `tail` pointer to point to the last node in the list.

The function then returns the difference between the `tail` pointer and the `head` pointer, which is the size of the list.

There are no memory, buffer, or pointer issues in the code you provided. The function is well-written and follows best practices for C programming.</s>
