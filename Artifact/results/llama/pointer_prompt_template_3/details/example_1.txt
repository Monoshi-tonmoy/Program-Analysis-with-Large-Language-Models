The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int fun2() {
    int num = 10;
    int *intptr = &num;
    float *floatptr = (float *)&num;

    *floatptr = 20.5;

    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Value at floatptr: %f\n", *floatptr);

    return 0;
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided contains several potential security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Integer overflow**: The code initializes an integer variable `num` with the value 10. However, the function then casts the address of `num` to a `float *` and assigns it to `floatptr`. This is a classic example of an integer overflow vulnerability, as the address of `num` is being cast to a floating-point type, which can result in a buffer overflow attack.
2. **Buffer overflow**: The code then assigns the value 20.5 to `*floatptr`, which is a floating-point value. This can result in a buffer overflow attack if the buffer pointed to by `floatptr` is not large enough to hold the value.
3. **Use-after-free**: The code then prints the value of `num` using `printf`. However, the function has already assigned a floating-point value to `*floatptr`, which means that the memory location pointed to by `num` has been freed. This can result in a use-after-free vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
4. **Format string vulnerability**: The code uses `printf` to print the value of `num` and `*floatptr`. However, the format string is not properly sanitized, which can result in a format string vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that causes the function to print arbitrary data.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should be modified as follows:

1. Use a secure casting mechanism, such as `static_cast`, to cast the address of `num` to a `float *`. This will ensure that the address is properly aligned and that the buffer is large enough to hold the value.
2. Use a secure method to assign the value 20.5 to `*floatptr`, such as `memcpy` or `strcpy`. This will ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the value and that the memory is properly aligned.
3. Use a secure method to print the value of `num` and `*floatptr`, such as `printf_s` or `snprintf`. This will ensure that the format string
