The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    while(i < len) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
        i++;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return i;
}

int tx_int(char *ptr) {
    int val = OBJ_SIZE;
    while(val < OBJ_SIZE) {
        send_msg(ptr, 16);
    }
    free(ptr);
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided contains several potential security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse. Here are some of the issues I identified:

1. Use-after-free vulnerability:
In the `send_msg` function, the `free(ptr)` statement is called after the `buf_write_msg(ptr + i)` statement. This means that the memory pointed to by `ptr` is freed before it is used in the `buf_write_<s>
msg` function. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where an attacker can exploit the freed memory to execute arbitrary code.
2. Buffer overflow vulnerability:
In the `send_msg` function, the `buf_write_msg` function is called with a pointer to the `ptr` buffer, which is passed as an argument to the `send_msg` function. If the `ptr` buffer is not large enough to hold the data being written to it, a buffer overflow vulnerability can occur.
3. Integer overflow vulnerability:
In the `tx_int` function, the `val` variable is initialized to `OBJ_SIZE`, which is a constant. The `while` loop then increments `val` by 16 until it is greater than or equal to `OBJ_SIZE`. However, if `OBJ_SIZE` is a large value, the `val` variable can overflow, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability.
4. Freeing of uninitialized memory:
In the `tx_int` function, the `free(ptr)` statement is called after the `send_msg` function has been called. However, the `ptr` variable is not initialized before it is passed to the `send_msg` function, which can lead to a freeing of uninitialized memory.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should consider the following:

1. Use a secure memory allocation function, such as `malloc`, to allocate memory for the `ptr` buffer in the `send_msg` function. This will ensure that the memory is properly initialized and freed.
2. Use a secure buffer writing function, such as `memcpy`, to write data to the `ptr` buffer in the `send_msg` function. This will ensure that the buffer is not overflowed.
3. Use a secure integer comparison function, such as `mem
