You are a program analyst specializing in security vulnerabilities related to memory, buffer, and pointer misuse.

The following C / C++ code may or may not contain misuses such as memory, buffer or pointer issues, and is enclosed in triple backticks. Analyze the following code
'''
int foo(struc ptr*) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
''' [/INST]  The code you provided contains two potential memory safety issues:

1. Double free: The function `free(ptr->member)` and `free(ptr<s>
    ptr->field)` may free the same memory block twice, which is undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or security vulnerabilities.
2. Use-after-free: After freeing the memory block, the function returns a pointer to the freed memory block, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

To fix the issues, you can:

1. Use a smart pointer like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage the memory automatically.
2. Use a `std::vector` or `std::array` to store the data, which can automatically manage the memory and prevent use-after-free issues.
3. Use a `std::string` or `std::string_view` to store the data, which can automatically manage the memory and prevent use-after-free issues.
4. Use a `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to store the data, and use the `std::move` function to move the data to the return value.

Here is an example of how you can fix the issues:
```
int foo(std::unique_ptr<struc> ptr) {
    free(ptr->member);
    free(ptr->field);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `std::unique_ptr` is used to manage the memory automatically, and the `free` function is not needed. The `std::move` function is used to move the data to the return value.

It's important to note that the code you provided is a simplified example, and the actual code may have other issues that need to be addressed. It's always a good idea to review the code thoroughly and use tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer to detect memory safety issues.</s>
