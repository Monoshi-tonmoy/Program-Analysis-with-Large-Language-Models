Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by identifying the decision points and loops in the program.

Decision Points:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines three variables: `A`, `B`, and `sum`, which are used to store the two numbers entered by the user and the sum of those numbers, respectively.
3. The program then uses the `printf` function to ask the user to enter two numbers.
4. The program then uses the `scanf` function to read the two numbers entered by the user.
5. The program then calculates the sum of the two numbers using the `+` operator.
6. The program then uses the `printf` function to print the sum of the two numbers.
7. The program then returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

Loops:

1. The program does not contain any loops.

Based on the above analysis, the control flow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
