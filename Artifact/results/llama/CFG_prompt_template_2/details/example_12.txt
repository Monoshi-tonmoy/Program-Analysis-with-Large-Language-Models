Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by understanding the sequence of events that occur when the program is executed. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.

The program then defines a function called `print_table`, which takes two integer arguments: `range` and `num`. The function first declares a variable called `mul` to store the product of `num` and `i`.

The function then uses a `for` loop to calculate the multiplication table of `num` from 1 to `range`. Inside the loop, the function multiplies `num` and `i` and stores the result in `mul`. The function then prints the multiplication table using the `printf` function.

After the loop, the function returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The main function of the program is then executed. The main function first declares two integer variables: `range` and `num`. The main function then calls the `print_table` function with `range` and `num` as arguments.

The control flow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
