You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by understanding the decision points and loops in the code.

Decision Points:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input and output functions.
2. The program then defines an array `arr1` of integers with 5 rows and 5 columns.
3. The program then defines an array `arr2` of pointers to integers with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4. The program then initializes each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`.
5. The program then prints the values in `arr2` using a nested loop.

Loops:

1. The program has two loops: a nested loop and a loop that iterates over the elements of `arr2`.
2. The nested loop iterates over the elements of `arr1` and initializes each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`.
3. The loop that iterates over the elements of `arr2` prints the values in `arr2` using the `printf` function.

Overall, the control flow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file.
2. The program then defines two arrays: `arr1` and `arr2`.
3. The program then initializes each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`.
4. The program then prints the values in `arr2` using a nested loop.
5. The program ends by returning 0.

In summary, the control flow of the program involves including the `stdio.h` header file, defining two arrays, initializing each element of `arr2` with the address of the corresponding element in `arr1`, and printing the values in `arr2` using a nested loop.</s>
