You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` header files.
2. The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The program prompts the user to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `x` to exit) and reads the input using `scanf`.
4. The program then prompts the user to enter two operands and reads the input using `scanf`.
5. The program uses a `switch` statement to differentiate between the different operations based on the operator entered by the user.
6. For each operation, the program performs the appropriate calculation and prints the result using `printf`.
7. The program then prints a newline character using `printf`.
8. The program loops back to step 3 and repeats the process until the user enters `x` to exit.

The decision points in the program are:

* The `switch` statement in the `main` function, which determines which operation to perform based on the operator entered by the user.
* The `if` statement in the `main` function, which checks whether the user has entered `x` to exit the program.

The loops in the program are:

* The `while` loop in the `main` function, which repeats the process of prompting the user to enter an operator and operands until the user enters `x` to exit.</s>
