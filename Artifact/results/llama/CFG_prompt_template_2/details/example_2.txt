You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program then defines a function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer argument `N`.
3. The function first calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`).
4. The function then checks if the remainder is equal to 0. If it is, the function prints "Even" using the `printf` function.
5. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function prints "Odd" using the `printf` function.
6. The function then returns, and the program ends.

The decision points in the control flow of the program are:

* The `if` statement in the `checkEvenOdd` function, which checks if the remainder is equal to 0.
* The `else` statement in the `checkEvenOdd` function, which prints "Odd" if the remainder is not equal to 0.

The loops in the control flow of the program are:

* There are no loops in the program.

The program has a single path of execution, which starts at the beginning of the program and ends at the end of the program. The program does not have any conditional statements or loops, so there is only one possible path of execution.</s>
