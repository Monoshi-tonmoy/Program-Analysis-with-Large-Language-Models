You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the simple interest of an investment. The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The `main` function initializes three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which represent the principal, rate, and time of the investment, respectively.
4. The program calculates the simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`.
5. The program prints the simple interest using the `printf` function.
6. The program returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

The decision points in the program are:

* The `if` statement in the `main` function, which checks whether the user has entered a valid input for the investment period.
* The `if` statement in the `main` function, which checks whether the user has entered a valid input for the interest rate.

The loops in the program are:

* The `while` loop in the `main` function, which allows the user to enter a new investment period until a valid input is entered.
* The `while` loop in the `main` function, which allows the user to enter a new interest rate until a valid input is entered.

The program has a single path of execution, which starts at the `main` function and ends at the `return` statement. The program does not have any conditional statements or loops that can cause the program to execute different paths.</s>
