You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts execution at the `main` function.
2. The `main` function declares two variables: `num` and `result`.
3. The `main` function calls the `factorial` function with the argument `num`.
4. The `factorial` function declares two variables: `result` and `i`.
5. The `factorial` function initializes `result` to 1 and `i` to 2.
6. The `factorial` function enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
7. Inside the loop, the `result` variable is multiplied by `i`.
8. The loop increments `i` by 1.
9. The loop repeats until `i` is greater than `n`.
10. After the loop, the `factorial` function returns the value of `result`.
11. The `main` function prints the result of the `factorial` function to the console.
12. The `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

The decision points in the program are:

* The `main` function calls the `factorial` function with the argument `num`.
* The `factorial` function enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
* The `factorial` function returns the value of `result`.

The loops in the program are:

* The loop in the `factorial` function that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive).</s>
