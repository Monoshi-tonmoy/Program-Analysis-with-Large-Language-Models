You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C++ Program to display alphabets using ASCII values
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i;

	cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of A=65 and Z=90
	for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}

	cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";

	// ASCII value of a=97 and z=122
	for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
		// Integer i with %c will be converted to character
		// before printing.%c will takes its equivalent
		// character value
		cout << (char)i << " ";
	}
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `iostream` header file, which provides input and output operations.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement brings the `std` namespace into the program, allowing the use of standard library functions without qualification.
3. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it is where the program's control flow begins.
4. The first `for` loop initializes the variable `i` to 65 (the ASCII value of the character 'A') and iterates until `i` is less than or equal to 90 (the ASCII value of the character 'Z').
5. Inside the loop, the `char` cast operator is used to convert the integer value of `i` to its corresponding ASCII character. The character is then printed to the console using `cout`.
6. The second `for` loop initializes the variable `i` to 97 (the ASCII value of the character 'a') and iter<s>
