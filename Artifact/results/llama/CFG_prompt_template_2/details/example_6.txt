You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and converts it to Celsius using a function called `fahrenheit_to_celsius`. The function takes a single parameter, `f`, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit. The function returns the temperature in Celsius.

The program also includes a `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. The `main` function takes no parameters and returns an integer value.

Now, let's analyze the control flow of the program:

1. The program starts executing at the `main` function.
2. The `main` function declares a variable `f` and initializes it to 40.
3. The `main` function then calls the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function and passes `f` as a parameter.
4. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function takes the parameter `f` and performs the necessary calculations to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
5. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function returns the converted temperature to the `main` function.
6. The `main` function then prints the converted temperature to the console using the `printf` function.
7. The `main` function then returns an integer value, which is the exit status of the program.

In terms of decision points and loops, the program has no decision points or loops. The program simply takes input, performs a calculation, and then prints the output. There are no conditional statements or loops that control the flow of the program.</s>
