You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by identifying the decision points and loops in the code.

Decision Points:

1. The first decision point is at line 13, where the program checks if the value of `a` is 0. If it is, the program prints "Invalid" and returns.
2. The second decision point is at line 21, where the program checks if the value of `d` is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints "Roots are real and different" and calculates the roots.
3. The third decision point is at line 26, where the program checks if the value of `d` is equal to 0. If it is, the program prints "Roots are real and same" and calculates the root.
4. The fourth decision point is at line 31, where the program checks if the value of `d` is less than 0. If it is, the program prints "Roots are complex" and calculates the roots.

Loops:

1. The program does not contain any loops.

Based on the above analysis, the control flow of the program can be represented as follows:

1. The program starts at line 13, where the value of `a` is checked.
2. If `a` is 0, the program prints "Invalid" and returns.
3. If `a` is not 0, the program continues to line 21, where the value of `d` is calculated.
4. If `d` is greater than 0, the program prints "Roots are real and different" and calculates the roots.
5. If `d` is equal to 0, the program prints "Roots are real and same" and calculates the root.
6. If `d` is less than 0, the program prints "Roots are complex" and calculates the roots.
7. The program ends at line 36, where the function returns.</s>
