You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its control flow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the decision points and loops in the control flow of a Computer program.

-Definition: Control flow information includes understanding how the program executes through different paths.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the control flow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The control flow of the program can be analyzed by understanding the flow of the program through different paths. The program has several decision points and loops, which determine the flow of the program.

1. Decision Points:
The program has several decision points, which are the points where the program makes a choice about which path to take. These decision points are determined by the `if` and `else` statements in the program.

For example, in the `fib` function, there are two decision points:

* The first decision point is when the function is called with a value of `n` that is less than 3. In this case, the function returns without printing anything.
* The second decision point is when the function is called with a value of `n` that is greater than or equal to 3. In this case, the function calls itself recursively with a value of `n - 1`.
2. Loops:
The program also has several loops, which are the points where the program repeats a section of code. The loops in the program are determined by the `for` and `while` statements.

For example, in the `printFib` function, there is a loop that repeats the code inside the loop for each value of `n` that is greater than 2. The loop is controlled by the `for` statement, which specifies the range of values for `n` and the code that should be executed for each value of `n`.

3. Control Flow:
The control flow of the program can be represented as a flowchart, which shows the different paths that the program can take. The flowchart for the program is as follows:

[Flowchart]

The flowchart shows the different paths that the program can take, including the decision points and loops. The program starts at the `main` function, which calls the `printFib` function with a value of `n` that is 9. The `printFib` function then calls the `fib` function with a value of `n` that is 9. The `fib` function then calls itself recursively with a value of `n - 1`, which is 8. The `fib` function then calls itself recursively with a value of `n - 2`, which is 7. The `fib` function then calls itself recursively with
