Please share the cyclic dependency analysis information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that uses recursion to print the Fibonacci series. The program has a cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions, which are both defined in the same file.

The `fib` function is a recursive function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function uses the `prev1` and `prev2` variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers, and it updates these variables as it recursively calls itself.

The `printFib` function is a wrapper function that handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series (0 and 1) and then calls the `fib` function to print the remaining terms. The `printFib` function also has a cyclic dependency with the `fib` function, as it calls the `fib` function to print the remaining terms.

The cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions is not a problem in this case, as the functions are designed to work together to print the Fibonacci series. However, in general, cyclic dependencies between functions can make the code harder to understand and maintain, and it is a good practice to avoid them whenever possible.</s>
