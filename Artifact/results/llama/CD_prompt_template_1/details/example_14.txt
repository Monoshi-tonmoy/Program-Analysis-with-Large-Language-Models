Please share the cyclic dependency analysis information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The program uses a while loop to check if the maximum of the two numbers is divisible by both numbers. If it is, the program prints the LCM and exits.

Here is the cyclic dependency analysis information for the program:

1. The main function has a cyclic dependency on itself. This is because the main function calls itself recursively until the LCM is found.
2. The main function has a cyclic dependency on the while loop. This is because the while loop is executed repeatedly until the LCM is found, and the main function calls the while loop.
3. The while loop has a cyclic dependency on the main function. This is because the while loop is executed repeatedly until the LCM is found, and the main function calls the while loop.
4. The while loop has a cyclic dependency on itself. This is because the while loop is executed repeatedly until the LCM is found, and the while loop calls itself recursively.

The cyclic dependency analysis information shows that the program has a cyclic dependency between the main function and the while loop. This means that the program has a recursive structure, where the main function calls the while loop, which calls the main function again, and so on. This recursive structure is necessary for the program to work correctly, as it allows the program to repeatedly check if the maximum of the two numbers is divisible by both numbers until the LCM is found.</s>
