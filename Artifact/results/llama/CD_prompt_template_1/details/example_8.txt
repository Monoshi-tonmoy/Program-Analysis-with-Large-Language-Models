Please share the cyclic dependency analysis information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program has no cyclic dependencies, so there is no need to perform any analysis.

However, if you are asking about the cyclic dependency analysis of a program in general, it is a process of analyzing the dependencies between different modules or functions in a program to ensure that there are no cyclic dependencies. A cyclic dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other in a circular manner, creating a loop.

To perform cyclic dependency analysis, you can use a tool such as the "Cyclic Dependency Analyzer" or "Cyclic Dependency Checker" tool. These tools can help you identify the cyclic dependencies in your program and suggest ways to break them.

Here is an example of how you can use the "Cyclic Dependency Analyzer" tool to perform cyclic dependency analysis on a program:

1. Open the program you want to analyze in the "Cyclic Dependency Analyzer" tool.
2. Click on the "Analyze" button to start the analysis.
3. The tool will analyze the program and identify any cyclic dependencies.
4. If the tool identifies any cyclic dependencies, it will display them in a list.
5. You can then use the information provided by the tool to break the cyclic dependencies and improve the structure of your program.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</s>
