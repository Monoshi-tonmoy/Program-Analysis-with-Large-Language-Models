Please share the cyclic dependency analysis information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided has a cyclic dependency between the `factorial` function and the `main` function. The `factorial` function calls itself recursively, and the `main` function calls the `factorial` function. This creates a cycle where the `main` function calls the `factorial` function, which calls itself, which then calls the `main` function again, and so on.

To break this cycle, you can use a technique called "memoization" or "dynamic programming". This involves caching the results of the `factorial` function for each input, so that the function doesn't have to recalculate the factorial for the same input multiple times.

Here's an example of how you could modify the program to use memoization:
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	static int cache[100] = { 0 }; // cache for factorials

	// check if the factorial has already been calculated
	if (cache[n] != 0) {
		return cache[n];
	}

	// calculate the factorial
	int result = 1, i;
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	// cache the result
	cache[n] = result;

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
```
In this modified program, the `factorial` function checks if the factorial has already been calculated for the given input. If it has, it returns the cached result. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial and caches the result for future use. This breaks the cycle between the `factorial` function and the `main` function, and allows the program to run without any errors.</s>
