Please share the cyclic dependency analysis information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided has no cyclic dependencies. It is a simple C program that reads two numbers from the user, calcul<s>
ates their sum using the '+' operator, and then prints the result.

Here is the analysis of the program:

1. The program has a main function that is the entry point of the program.
2. The main function declares three variables: A, B, and sum.
3. The main function uses the scanf function to read two numbers from the user.
4. The main function calculates the sum of A and B using the '+' operator.
5. The main function prints the sum using the printf function.
6. The main function returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The main function does not call itself, and there are no other functions that call each other in a cyclic manner.</s>
