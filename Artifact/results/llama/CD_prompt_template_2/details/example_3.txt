You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that finds the roots of a quadratic equation. The program has a function called `findRoots` that takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints the roots of the equation `ax*2 + bx + c = 0`.

The program has a cyclic dependency between the `findRoots` function and the `main` function. The `main` function calls the `findRoots` function, which in turn calls the `sqrt` function from the `math.h` library. The `sqrt` function is defined in the `math.h` library, which is included in the program.

The `findRoots` function also calls the `abs` function from the `math.h` library, which is used to calculate the absolute value of the discriminant `d`. The `abs` function is also defined in the `math.h` library.

The `main` function also includes a call to the `printf` function from the `stdio.h` library, which is used to print the roots of the equation to the console.

The program has a total of 4 dependencies:

* `findRoots` depends on `sqrt` and `abs` from `math.h`
* `main` depends on `findRoots` and `printf` from `stdio.h`
* `sqrt` and `abs` depend on `math.h`
* `printf` depends on `stdio.h`

The program has a cyclic dependency between the `findRoots` function and the `main` function, but it does not have any other cyclic dependencies.</s>
