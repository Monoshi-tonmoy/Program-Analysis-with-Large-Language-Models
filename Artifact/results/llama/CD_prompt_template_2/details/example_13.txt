Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that prints the Fibonacci series using recursion. The program has a cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions.

The `fib` function is a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number and prints it. The `fib` function calls itself with the argument `n - 1` until it reaches the base case `n < 3`, where it returns the result.

The `printFib` function is a wrapper function that handles the first two terms and calls the `fib` function with the argument `n - 2`. The `printFib` function also handles the case where the number of terms is less than 1, and it prints an error message in that case.

The cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions arises because the `fib` function calls the `printFib` function with the argument `n - 2`, and the `printFib` function calls the `fib` function with the argument `n - 1`. This creates a cycle between the two functions, where the `fib` function calls the `printFib` function, which calls the `fib` function again, and so on.

To break this cycle, you can modify the `fib` function to only call the `printFib` function with the argument `n - 1` when the number of terms is greater than 2. This way, the `fib` function will only call the `printFib` function once, and the cycle will be broken.

Here's the modified code:
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	if (n > 2) { 
		printF
