You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a simple calculator that takes in two operands and an operator and performs the corresponding operation. The program uses a `switch` statement to differentiate between the different operations based on the operator entered by the user.

After analyzing the program, I did not find any cyclic dependencies. The program is structured in a linear fashion, with each operation being performed in a separate case statement within the `switch` statement. There are no loops or jumps that create a cycle in the program's control flow.

Therefore, the program does not have any cyclic dependencies, and the analysis is complete.</s>
