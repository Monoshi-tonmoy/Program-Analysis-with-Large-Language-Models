You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided has a cyclic dependency between the two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. The dependency is formed because the elements of `arr2` are pointers to the elements of `arr1`, and the elements of `arr1` are being used to initialize the elements of `arr2`.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the cyclic dependency:

1. The program starts by declaring two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, with the same dimensions.
2. The elements of `arr1` are initialized with some values.
3. The elements of `arr2` are initialized with the addresses of the elements of `arr1`.
4. The program then uses the array of pointers `arr2` to print the values of `arr1`.

The cyclic dependency is formed because the elements of `arr2` are pointers to the elements of `arr1`, and the elements of `arr1` are being used to initialize the elements of `arr2`. This creates a cycle between the two arrays, where the elements of `arr2` depend on the elements of `arr1`, and the elements of `arr1` depend on the elements of `arr2`.

To break this cyclic dependency, you could initialize the elements of `arr2` with the addresses of the elements of `arr1` after the elements of `arr1` have been initialized. This would remove the cyclic dependency and make the program more efficient.

Here is an example of how you could modify the program to break the cyclic dependency:
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0
