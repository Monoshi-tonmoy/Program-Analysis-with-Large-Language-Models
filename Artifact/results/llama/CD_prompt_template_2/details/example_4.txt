Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that interchanges the elements of the first and last rows of a matrix. The program has a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a matrix as input and swaps the elements of the first and last rows. The program also has a driver code that calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function and prints the input and output matrices.

To analyze the cyclic dependencies in the program, we need to identify the dependencies between the different parts of the program. In this case, the program has the following dependencies:

1. The `interchangeFirstLast` function depends on the `n` macro, which is defined in the `stdio.h` header file.
2. The `interchangeFirstLast` function depends on the `m` matrix, which is passed as an argument to the function.
3. The `main` function depends on the `interchangeFirstLast` function, as it calls the function to swap the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix.
4. The `main` function depends on the `m` matrix, as it prints the input and output matrices.

Based on these dependencies, we can draw a dependency graph that shows the cyclic dependencies between the different parts of the program. The dependency graph is shown below:
```
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  interchangeFirstLast  |
                                  +---------------+
                                           |
                                           |
                                           v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  main  |
                                  +---------------+
                                           |
                                           |
                                           v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  m  |
                                  +---------------+
                                           |
                                           |
                                           v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  n  |
                                  +---------------+
```
In this graph, the `interchangeFirstLast` function is at the top, and it depends on the `n` macro and the `m` matrix. The `main` function is in the middle, and it depends on the `interchangeFirstLast` function and the `m` matrix. The `m` matrix is at the bottom, and it is used by both the `interchangeFirstLast` function and the `main` function
