<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>
void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
}
// Driver code
int main()
{

	// The range of the
	// Multiplication table
	int range = 10;

	// The number to calculate the
	// Multiplication table
	int num = 5;

	// Calling the Function.
	print_table(range, num);

	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that demonstrates the multiplication table of a number. The program has a function called `print_table` that takes two arguments: `range` and `num`. The function calculates the multiplication table of `num` and prints it on the screen.

To analyze the cyclic dependencies in the program, we need to identify the dependencies between the different parts of the program. In this case, the program has the following dependencies:

1. The `main` function depends on the `print_table` function. The `main` function calls the `print_<s>
table` function to print the multiplication table.
2. The `print_table` function depends on the `printf` function. The `print_table` function uses the `printf` function to print the multiplication table.
3. The `printf` function depends on the `main` function. The `printf` function is called by the `main` function to print the multiplication table.

These dependencies form a cycle, where the `main` function depends on the `print_table` function, which depends on the `printf` function, which depends on the `main` function. This cycle is the cyclic dependency in the program.

To break this cycle, we can move the `printf` function out of the `print_table` function and make it a separate function. This way, the `main` function can call the `print_table` function, which can call the `printf` function, without creating a cyclic dependency.

Here's the modified program with the cyclic dependency removed:
```
// C program to Demonstrate the
// Multiplication table of a number
#include <stdio.h>

void print_table(int range, int num)
{
	// Declaring a variable mul to store the product.
	int mul;

	// For loop to calculate the Multiplication table.
	for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {
		// To store the product.
		mul = num * i;

		// Printing the Multiplication Table.
		printf("%d * %d = %d", num, i, mul);

		// Proceeding to the next line.
		printf("\n");
	}
