You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The program does not have any cyclic dependencies.

The program consists of a single function, `main`, which is the entry point of the program. The function calcul<s>
ates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length `l` and breadth `b` using the formulae `area = l * b` and `perimeter = 2 * (l + b)`. The results are then printed to the console using the `printf` function.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program because there are no dependencies between the different parts of the program. The `main` function is the only function in the program, and it does not depend on any other functions. The program is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries or functions.

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis of this program is:

* No cyclic dependencies found.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to analyze a different program.</s>
