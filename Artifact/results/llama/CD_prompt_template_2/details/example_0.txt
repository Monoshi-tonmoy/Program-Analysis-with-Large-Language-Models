You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a simple C program that reads an integer from the user and then prints it back to the user. The program does not contain any cyclic dependencies.

However, I can provide you with an example of a program that contains cyclic dependencies. Here is an example of a program that has a cyclic dependency:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scan<s>
    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this program, the `scanf` function is used to read an integer from the user and store it in the `number` variable. The `printf` function is then used to print the value of `number` to the console.

The cyclic dependency in this program is between the `scanf` and `printf` functions. The `scanf` function depends on the `printf` function to print the input prompt to the console, while the `printf` function depends on the `scanf` function to read the input from the user. This creates a cyclic dependency between the two functions, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain the program.

To resolve this cyclic dependency, you can separate the input and output functions into separate functions, like this:
```
#include <stdio.h>

void read_input(int* number) {
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", number);
}

void print_output(int number) {
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
}

int main() {
    int number;

    read_input(&number);
    print_output(number);

    return 0;
}
```
In this modified program, the `read_input` function is responsible for reading the input from the user and storing it in the `number` variable, while the `print_output` function is responsible for printing the input to the console. The `main` function simply calls these two functions in sequence.

By separating the input and output functions into separate functions, we have removed the cyclic dependency between them, making the program easier to understand and maintain.</s>
