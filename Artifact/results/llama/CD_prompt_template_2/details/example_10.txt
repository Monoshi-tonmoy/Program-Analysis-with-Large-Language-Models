You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The program has a single function `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. The function uses a loop to calculate the factorial by multiplying the numbers from 2 to `n`.

The program also has a `main` function that is the entry point of the program. The `main` function takes no input and returns an integer value. The `main` function calls the `factorial` function with the input `num` and prints the result to the console.

There are no cyclic dependencies in the program. The `factorial` function is called only once in the `main` function, and there are no recursive calls or other dependencies that could create a cycle.

Here is the dependency graph for the program:
```
digraph G {
  factorial [shape=box];
  main [shape=box];
  factorial -> main;
}
```
The graph shows that the `factorial` function is called by the `main` function, but there are no other dependencies between the two functions.</s>
