You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a simple C program that takes two numbers as input from the user, adds them, and prints the result. The program does not have any cyclic dependencies.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program starts with the `#include <stdio.h>` directive, which includes the `stdio.h` header file. This header file contains functions for input and output operations.
2. The next line is `int main()`, which is the entry point of the program. The `main` function is the first function that is executed when the program starts.
3. Inside the `main` function, the program declares three variables: `A`, `B`, and `sum`. The `A` and `B` variables are declared as `int`s, which means they can hold integer values. The `sum` variable is also declared as an `int`, which means it can hold the result of the addition of `A` and `B`.
4. The program then uses the `printf` function to print a message to the user asking them to enter two numbers. The `printf` function is used to print a message to the user. The message is enclosed in double quotes and contains the `%d` format specifier, which tells the function to expect an integer value.
5. The program then uses the `scanf` function to read two numbers from the user. The `scanf` function is used to read input from the user. The `%d` format specifier tells the function to expect an integer value. The `&A` and `&B` variables are used to store the addresses of the `A` and `B` variables, which are used to store the input values.
6. The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator. The result of the addition is stored in the `sum` variable.
7. Finally, the program uses the `printf` function to print the result of the addition. The `printf` function is used to print a message to the user. The message is enclosed in double quotes and contains the `%d` format specifier, which tells the function to expect an integer value. The `sum` variable is used to print the result of the addition.

In summary, the program does not have any cyclic dependencies. The program starts with the `main` function, which declares
