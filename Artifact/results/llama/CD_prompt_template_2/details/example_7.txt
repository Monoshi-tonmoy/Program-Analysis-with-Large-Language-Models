You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the simple interest of a principal amount P for a time T at an interest rate R. The program does not have any cyclic dependencies.

The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions such as `printf`.

The program then defines three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which are the principal amount, interest rate, and time, respectively. These variables are initialized with the values 1, 1, and 1, respectively.

The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`. The result is stored in the `SI` variable.

Finally, the program prints the simple interest using the `printf` function.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program because there are no loops or recursive function calls that could create a cycle. The program simply calculates the simple interest and prints the result.</s>
