You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Computer program.

-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the cyclic dependency analysis details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. The program has a single function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer argument `N`. The function first calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the function prints "Even" to the console, otherwise it prints "Odd".

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The function `checkEvenOdd` is called once in the main function, and it does not call any other functions. Therefore, there is no cyclic dependency in this program.</s>
