Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program is written in C and it is a simple program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The program uses a while loop to check if the max variable is divisible by x and y, and if it is, it prints the LCM and breaks out of the loop.

The dataflow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring three variables: x, y, and max.
2. The program then initializes the variables with the values 15, 25, and 0, respectively.
3. The program then checks if x is greater than y, and if it is, it sets max to x. Otherwise, it sets max to y.
4. The program then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely.
5. Inside the while loop, the program checks if max is divisible by x and y. If it is, it prints the LCM and breaks out of the loop.
6. If max is not divisible by x and y, the program increments max by 1 and repeats the loop.
7. The program then exits the loop and returns 0.

The dataflow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
