You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a simple C program that takes an integer input from the user and displays it back to the user. The dataflow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines an integer variable called `number`.
3. The program uses the `printf` function to display a message to the user, asking them to enter an integer.
4. The program then uses the `scanf` function to read the user's input and store it in the `number` variable.
5. The program then uses the `printf` function again to display the user's input back to them.
6. The program ends by returning a value of 0 to indicate that it completed successfully.

The dataflow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
