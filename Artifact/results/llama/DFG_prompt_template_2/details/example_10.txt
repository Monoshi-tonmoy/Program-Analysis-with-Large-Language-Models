You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program then defines a function called `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input.
3. The `factorial` function initializes a variable `result` to 1 and a variable `i` to 2.
4. The function then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n`, inclusive.
5. Inside the loop, the function multiplies `result` by `i` and assigns the result back to `result`.
6. After the loop, the function returns `result`.
7. The `main` function is then called, which initializes a variable `num` to 5.
8. The `main` function then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as input, and prints the result to the console.
9. The program then returns 0, indicating that it has completed successfully.

The dataflow of the program can be represented as follows:
```
