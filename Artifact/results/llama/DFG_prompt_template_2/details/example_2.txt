You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a C program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is even or odd. The program uses the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of the input number by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even, otherwise it is odd.

The dataflow of the program can be described as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines a function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer input `N`.
3. The function first finds the remainder of the division of `N` by 2 using the modulo operator (%).
4. The function then checks if the remainder is 0. If it is, the number is even, and the function prints "Even" to the console.
5. If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd, and the function prints "Odd" to the console.
6. The function then returns, and the program ends.

The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The user inputs an integer `N`.
2. The program calls the `checkEvenOdd` function with `N` as an argument.
3. The function finds the remainder of the division of `N` by 2 using the modulo operator (%).
4. The function checks if the remainder is 0. If it is, the number is even, and the function prints "Even" to the console.
5. If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd, and the function prints "Odd" to the console.
6. The function returns, and the program ends.</s>
