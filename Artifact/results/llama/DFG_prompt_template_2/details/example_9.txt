``` [/INST]  The program is written in C++ and it is a simple program that displays the alphabets from A to Z and a to z using ASCII values.

The program starts with the inclusion of the header file `iostream` which is the standard input/output stream library in C++.

The next line is the `using namespace std;` statement, which allows the use of the `std` namespace without having to type it out every time.

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and it is where the program execution begins.

The first line of the `main()` function is `int i;`, which declares an integer variable `i`.

The next line is `cout << "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:\n";`, which prints the string "Alphabets from (A-Z) are:" to the console.

The next line is `for (i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {`, which starts a for loop that runs from 65 to 90, which are the ASCII values of the uppercase letters A to Z.

The next line is `cout << (char)i << " ";`, which converts the integer `i` to a character using the `(char)` cast, and then prints it to the console with a space after it.

The next line is `cout << "\nAlphabets from (a-z) are:\n";`, which prints the string "Alphabets from (a-z) are:" to the console.

The next line is `for (i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {`, which starts a for loop that runs from 97 to 122, which are the ASCII values of the lowercase letters a to z.

The next line is `cout << (char)i << " ";`, which converts the integer `i` to a character using the `(char)` cast, and then prints it to the console with a space after it.

The last line of the program is `return 0;`, which returns an integer value of 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully.

The program ends with the closing brace `}`.

The dataflow of the program is as follows:
