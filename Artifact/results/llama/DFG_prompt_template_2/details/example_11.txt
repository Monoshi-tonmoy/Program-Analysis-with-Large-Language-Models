You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by asking the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /), or press x to exit.
2. The user enters an operator or x to exit.
3. If the user enters an operator, the program asks the user to enter two operands (a and b).
4. The program then performs the operation based on the operator entered by the user.
5. The result of the operation is displayed to the user.
6. The program then asks the user if they want to perform another operation.
7. If the user enters x, the program exits.
8. If the user enters another operator, the program repeats steps 3-7.

The dataflow of the program is controlled by the switch case statement, which allows the program to differentiate between different operations based on the operator entered by the user. The program uses the scanf function to read input from the user and the printf function to display output to the user.</s>
