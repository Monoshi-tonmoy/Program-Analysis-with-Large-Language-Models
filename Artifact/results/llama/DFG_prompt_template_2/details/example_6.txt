// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a C program that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and converts it to Celsius using the formula: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) Ã— 5/9.

The program consists of two functions:

1. `main()`: This is the entry point of the program. It takes the input temperature in Fahrenheit and passes it to the `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function. The function returns the temperature in Celsius, which is then printed to the console using the `printf()` function.
2. `fahrenheit_to_celsius()`: This function takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius using the formula mentioned above.

The dataflow of the program can be described as follows:

1. The program starts executing at the `main()` function.
2. The `main()` function takes the input temperature in Fahrenheit from the user and passes it to the `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function.
3. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` function calculates the temperature in Celsius using the formula and returns the result to the `main()` function.
4. The `main()` function prints the temperature in Celsius to the console using the `printf()` function.
5. The program ends.

The dataflow diagram for the program is as follows:
