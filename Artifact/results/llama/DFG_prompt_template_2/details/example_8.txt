Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a C program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The dataflow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions such as `printf()`.
2. The program then defines two integer variables `l` and `b`, which represent the length and breadth of the rectangle, respectively.
3. The program then calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b`. The area is stored in a temporary variable, which is then passed to the `printf()` function to print the result.
4. The program then calculates the perimeter of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and adding 2 to the result. The perimeter is also stored in a temporary variable, which is then passed to the `printf()` function to print the result.
5. The program then returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

The dataflow of the program can be represented as follows:
