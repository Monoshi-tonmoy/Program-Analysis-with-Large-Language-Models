Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a C program that prints the Fibonacci series using recursion. The program has two functions: `fib` and `printFib`.

The `fib` function is a recursive function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function works by maintaining two variables `prev1` and `prev2` that store the previous two Fibonacci numbers. The function first checks if `n` is less than 3, and if so, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number by adding `prev1` and `prev2`, and then updates `prev1` and `prev2` with the new values. The function then calls itself with `n - 1` as the input.

The `printFib` function is a wrapper function that handles the first two terms of the Fibonacci series (0 and 1) and then calls the `fib` function to print the remaining terms. The function first checks if the number of terms is less than 1, and if so, it prints an error message. If the number of terms is 1, it prints 0. If the number of terms is 2, it prints 0 and 1. If the number of terms is greater than 2, it prints 0 and 1, and then calls the `fib` function with `n - 2` as the input.

The main function is the driver code that calls the `printFib` function with the input `n = 9`.

The dataflow of the program can be understood as follows:

1. The main function calls the `printFib` function with `n = 9`.
2. The `printFib` function checks if the number of terms is less than 1, and if so, it prints an error message.
3. The `printFib` function checks if the number of terms is 1, and if so, it prints 0.
4. The `print<s>
5. The `printFib` function checks if the number of terms is 2, and if so, it prints 0 and 1.
6. The `printFib` function calls the `fib` function with `n - 2` as the input.
