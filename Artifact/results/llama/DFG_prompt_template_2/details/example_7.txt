Please analyze and provide details on the dataflow in a Computer program.

-Definition: Dataflow information includes understanding how data is manipulated and flows through different parts of the program.


Now, based on the given information, Please share the dataflow details of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program is a C program that calculates the simple interest of an investment. The program takes three inputs: the principal amount (P), the interest rate (R), and the time (T) for which the principal is invested. The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100.

The dataflow of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring three variables: P, R, and T. These variables are used to store the principal amount, interest rate, and time, respectively.
2. The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100. The formula is calculated using the values of P, R, and T.
3. The program then prints the simple interest using the printf function.
4. The program ends by returning 0, indicating that the program has executed successfully.

The dataflow of the program can be represented as follows:
