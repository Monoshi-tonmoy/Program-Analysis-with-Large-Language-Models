<s> [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to make a Simple Calculator
// Using switch case
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
	char ch;
	double a, b;
	while (1) {
		printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /), "
			"if want to exit press x: ");
		scanf(" %c", &ch);

		// to exit
		if (ch == 'x')
			exit(0);
		printf("Enter two first and second operand: ");
		scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

		// Using switch case we will differentiate
		// operations based on different operator
		switch (ch) {

		// For Addition
		case '+':
			printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a + b);
			break;

		// For Subtraction
		case '-':
			printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a - b);
			break;

		// For Multiplication
		case '*':
			printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a * b);
			break;

		// For Division
		case '/':
			printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf\n", a, b, a / b);
			break;

		// If operator doesn't match any case constant
		default:
			printf(
				"Error! please write a valid operator\n");
		}

		printf("\n");
	}
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a simple calculator written in C. It uses a switch case to differentiate between different operations based on the operator entered by the user.

To analyze the cyclic dependencies in this program, we need to identify the modules or functions that are interdependent and form a cycle. In this case, there are no cyclic dependencies in the program.

The program consists of a single function, `main()`, which is the entry point of the program. The function reads input from the user, performs the operation based on the operator entered, and prints the result. There are no other functions or modules that are called or used by `main()`. Therefore, there are no cyclic dependencies in this program.

However, if we were to add more functions or modules to the program, we would need to analyze the dependencies between them to ensure that there are no cyclic dependencies. For example, if we were to add a function `add()` that performs addition and is called by `main()`, we would need to ensure that there is no cyclic dependency between `main()` and `add()`.</s>
