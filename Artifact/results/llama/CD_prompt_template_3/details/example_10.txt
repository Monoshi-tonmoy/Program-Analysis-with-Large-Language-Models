You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The program has a single function `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function uses a loop to calculate the factorial by multiplying the current number with the previous number until the input number is reached.

The program also has a `main` function that is the entry point of the program. The `main` function takes no input and returns an integer value. In this case, the `main` function calculates the factorial of 5 and prints it to the console.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The `factorial` function is called from the `main` function, but there is no cyclic dependency between the two functions. The `factorial` function does not call the `main` function, and the `main` function does not call the `factorial` function.

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis of this program is:

* The `factorial` function has no cyclic dependencies.
* The `main` function has no cyclic dependencies.

The program has a clear and simple structure, with no cyclic dependencies between functions.</s>
