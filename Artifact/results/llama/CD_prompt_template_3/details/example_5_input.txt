[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a Program Analyst.

Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Drivers code\nint main()\n{\n    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },\n                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },\n                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },\n                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },\n                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };\n    int* arr2[5][5];\n\n    // Initialising each element of the\n    // pointer array with the address of\n    // element present in the other array\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {\n            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Printing the array using\n    // the array of pointers\n    printf(\"The values are\\n\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {\n            printf(\"%d \", *arr2[i][j]);\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```"}]
