You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The program uses a while loop to check if the maximum of the two numbers is divisible by both numbers.

The cyclic dependencies in the program are:

1. The main function depends on the `max` variable, which is defined in the while loop.
2. The while loop depends on the `max` variable, which is defined in the main function.
3. The `max` variable depends on the `x` and `y` variables, which are defined in the main function.
4. The `x` and `y` variables depend on each other, as they are used to calculate the maximum of the two numbers.

The cyclic dependencies can be visualized as follows:
```
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  main function  |
                                  +---------------+
                                       |
                                       |
                                       v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  while loop  |
                                  +---------------+
                                       |
                                       |
                                       v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  max variable  |
                                  +---------------+
                                       |
                                       |
                                       v
                                  +---------------+
                                  |  x and y variables  |
                                  +---------------+
```
The cyclic dependencies can be resolved by rearranging the code to remove the cyclic dependencies. For example, the `max` variable can be defined outside of the while loop, and the `x` and `y` variables can be defined outside of the main function.

Here is an example of how the code can be rearranged to remove the cyclic dependencies:
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the max variable outside of the while loop
int max = (x > y) ? x : y;

// Define the x and y variables outside of the main function
int x = 15, y = 25;

// Driver code
int main() {
    // While loop to check if max variable is divisible by x and y
    while (1) {
        if (max % x == 0 && max % y
