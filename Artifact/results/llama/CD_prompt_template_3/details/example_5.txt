<s> [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initialising each element of the
    // pointer array with the address of
    // element present in the other array
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using
    // the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The given code has a cyclic dependency between the two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. The array `arr2` is an array of pointers to the elements of `arr1`, and the array `arr1` is an array of integers.

The cyclic dependency arises because the elements of `arr2` are pointers to the elements of `arr1`, and the elements of `arr1` are integers. This creates a situation where the elements of `arr2` are dependent on the elements of `arr1`, and the elements of `arr1` are dependent on the elements of `arr2`.

To break this cyclic dependency, we can use a technique called "lazy initialization". Instead of initializing the elements of `arr2` with the addresses of the elements of `arr1` in the same loop, we can initialize them in a separate loop after the elements of `arr1` have been initialized.

Here is an example of how we can modify the code to break the cyclic dependency:
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Drivers code
int main()
{
    int arr1[5][5] = { { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
                       { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                       { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 },
                       { 5, 4, 3, 2, 6 },
                       { 2, 5, 4, 3, 1 } };
    int* arr2[5][5];

    // Initializing the elements of arr2 with the addresses of the elements of arr1
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            arr2[i][j] = &arr1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Printing the array using the array of pointers
    printf("The values are\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *arr2[i][j]);
