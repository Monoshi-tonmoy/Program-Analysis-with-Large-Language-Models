You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // reads and stores input
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // displays output
    printf("You entered: %d", number);
    
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a simple C program that reads an integer from the user and then prints it back to the user. The program does not have any cyclic dependencies.

However, if we consider a more complex program with multiple modules and interdependent imports, we can analyze the cyclic dependencies using the following steps:

1. Identify the modules and their dependencies: In a program with multiple modules, each module may depend on other modules. We need to identify these dependencies and understand how they are interconnected.
2. Draw a dependency graph: We can draw a dependency graph to visualize the dependencies between modules. The graph will show the modules as nodes and the dependencies between them as edges.
3. Look for cycles: We need to look for cycles in the dependency graph. A cycle occurs when a module depends on another module that depends on the first module, creating a loop.
4. Analyze the cycles: Once we have identified the cycles, we need to analyze them to understand how they are causing problems. We may need to break the cycles by removing dependencies or reorganizing the code.

Here is an example of a program with cyclic dependencies:
```
#include <stdio.h>

// Module A
void print_message(const char* message) {
    printf("%s\n", message);
}

// Module B
void print_message_and_number(const char* message, int number) {
    print_message(message);
    printf("%d\n", number);
}

// Module C
void print_message_and_number_and_string(const char* message, int number, const char* string) {
    print_message_and_number(message, number);
    printf("%s\n", string);
}

int main() {
    print_message_and_number_and_string("Hello, world!", 42, "This is a string.");
    return 0;
}
```
In this program, we have three modules: A, B, and C. Module A defines a function `print_message` that takes a string argument and prints it to the console. Module B defines a function `print_message_and_number` that takes a string and an integer argument and prints both to the console. Module C defines a function `print_message_and_
