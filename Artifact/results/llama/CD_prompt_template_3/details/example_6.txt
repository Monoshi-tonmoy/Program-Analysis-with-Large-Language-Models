You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to convert 
// Fahrenheit to Celsius 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Function to convert Degree 
// Fahrenheit to Degree Celsius 
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float f) 
{ 
	return ((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0); 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	float f = 40; 

	// Passing parameter to function 
	printf("Temperature in Degree Celsius : %0.2f", 
		fahrenheit_to_celsius(f)); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. The program has a function `fahrenheit_to_celsius` that takes a float parameter `f` and returns the converted temperature in Celsius. The function uses the formula `((f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0)` to convert the temperature.

The program also has a `main` function that takes no parameters and returns an integer. The `main` function declares a float variable `f` and initializes it to 40. It then passes the value of `f` to the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function and prints the result to the console using the `printf` function.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The `main` function calls the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function, but the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function does not call the `main` function. Therefore, there is no cyclic dependency between the two functions.

However, the program does have a dependency between the `main` function and the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function. The `main` function depends on the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function to convert the temperature, and the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function depends on the `main` function to pass the temperature to be converted. This dependency is not cyclic, but it is still a dependency between the two functions.</s>
