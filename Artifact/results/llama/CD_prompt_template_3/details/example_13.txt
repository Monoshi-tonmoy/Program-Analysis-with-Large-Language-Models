You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that prints the Fibonacci series using recursion. The program has a cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions.

The `fib` function is a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number and prints it. The `printFib` function is called with the number of terms as an argument, and it calls the `fib` function with the number of terms minus 1 as an argument. The `fib` function then calculates the Fibonacci series and prints it.

The cyclic dependency between the `fib` and `printFib` functions is as follows:

1. The `fib` function calls the `printFib` function with the number of terms minus 1 as an argument.
2. The `printFib` function calls the `fib` function with the number of terms minus 1 as an argument.
3. The `fib` function calculates the Fibonacci series and prints it.
4. The `printFib` function prints the Fibonacci series.

This cyclic dependency is caused by the fact that the `fib` function calls the `printFib` function, which in turn calls the `fib` function again. This creates a cycle between the two functions, where the `fib` function depends on the `printFib` function, and the `printFib` function depends on the `fib` function.

To break this cyclic dependency, you could modify the `fib` function to only calculate the Fibonacci series and return it, without printing it. Then, the `printFib` function could call the `fib` function and print the Fibonacci series separately. This would remove the cyclic dependency between the two functions and make the program easier to understand and maintain.</s>
