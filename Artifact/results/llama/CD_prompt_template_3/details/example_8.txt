You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. It does not have any cyclic dependencies.

The program consists of a single function, `main`, which is the entry point of the program. The function calcul<s>
ates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length `l` and breadth `b` using the formulae `area = l * b` and `perimeter = 2 * (l + b)`.

The program does not have any dependencies on other modules or libraries, and it does not use any cyclic dependencies.

Therefore, the cyclic dependency analysis of this program is:

* The program has no cyclic dependencies.
* The program has a single function, `main`, which is the entry point of the program.
* The function calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length `l` and breadth `b` using the formulae `area = l * b` and `perimeter = 2 * (l + b)`.
* The program does not have any dependencies on other modules or libraries.</s>
