You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. The program has a single function `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer `N` as input and checks whether it is even or odd.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The function `checkEvenOdd` is called once in the main function, and it does not call any other functions. Therefore, there is no cyclic dependency in this program.

However, if you are looking for a Python program with cyclic dependencies, here is an example:
```
# Python program to demonstrate cyclic dependencies

# Function to check if a number is even or odd
def checkEvenOdd(N):
    # Find remainder
    r = N % 2

    # Condition for even
    if r == <s>

# Function to check if a number is even or odd
def checkEvenOdd(N):
    # Find remainder
    r = N % 2

    # Condition for even
    if r == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

# Main function
def main():
    # Get input from user
    N = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Call checkEvenOdd function
    checkEvenOdd(N)

# Call main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this program, there are two functions: `checkEvenOdd` and `main`. The `checkEvenOdd` function takes an integer `N` as input and checks whether it is even or odd. The `main` function gets input from the user and calls the `checkEvenOdd` function.

There is a cyclic dependency between the `checkEvenOdd` and `main` functions. The `main` function calls the `checkEvenOdd` function, which in turn calls the `main` function again. This creates a cyclic dependency between the two functions.

To break this cyclic dependency, you can move the `checkEvenOdd` function outside the `main` function and make it a separate function. This way, the `main` function will not call the `checkEvenOdd`
