Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.\n-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.\n\n-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nNow, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: \n```\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int number;\n\n    printf(\"Enter an integer: \");\n    \n    // reads and stores input\n    scanf(\"%d\", &number);\n\n    // displays output\n    printf(\"You entered: %d\", number);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```"}]
