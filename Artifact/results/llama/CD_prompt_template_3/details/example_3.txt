<s> [INST] <<SYS>>
You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find roots of
// a quadratic equation
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Prints roots of quadratic
// equation ax*2 + bx + x
void findRoots(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // If a is 0, then equation is
    // not quadratic, but linear
    if (a == 0) {
        printf("Invalid");
        return;
    }

    int d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
    double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d));

    if (d > 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and different\n");
        printf("%f\n%f", (double)(-b + sqrt_val) / (2 * a),
               (double)(-b - sqrt_val) / (2 * a));
    }
    else if (d == 0) {
        printf("Roots are real and same\n");
        printf("%f", -(double)b / (2 * a));
    }
    else // d < 0
    {
        printf("Roots are complex\n");
        printf("%f + i%f\n%f - i%f", -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a), -(double)b / (2 * a),
               sqrt_val / (2 * a));
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = -7, c = 12;

    // Function call
    findRoots(a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that finds the roots of a quadratic equation. The program has a function called `findRoots` that takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints the roots of the equation `ax*2 + bx + c = 0`. The function uses the quadratic formula to find the roots.

The program also has a `main` function that calls the `findRoots` function with the arguments `a = 1`, `b = -7`, and `c = 12`.

There are no cyclic dependencies in the program. The `findRoots` function is called from the `main` function, but there is no cyclic dependency between the two functions. The `main` function does not call any other functions that call `findRoots`, so there is no cyclic dependency between the functions.

The program is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of functions and variables makes the program modular and easy to maintain. The program also uses the `sqrt` function from the `math.h` library to calculate the square root of a number, which is a common operation in mathematics and computer science.

Overall, the program is well-written and easy to understand. There are no cyclic dependencies in the program, and the use of functions and variables makes the program modular and easy to maintain.</s>
