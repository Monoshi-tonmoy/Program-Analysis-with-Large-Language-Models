You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}

The program has no cyclic dependencies. The dependencies are as follows:

* The `main` function depends on the `printf` and `scanf` functions from the `stdio.h` header file.
* The `printf` and `scanf` functions depend on the `stdio.h` header file.
* The `main` function depends on the `sum` variable, which is declared in the same function.
* The `sum` variable depends on the `A` and `B` variables, which are declared in the same function.
* The `A` and `B` variables depend on the `scanf` function, which reads input from the user.

There are no cyclic dependencies in this program. The dependencies are all one-way, from the `main` function to the `stdio.h` header file, and from the `main` function to the `sum` variable, and from the `sum` variable to the `A` and `B` variables, and from the `A` and `B` variables to the `scanf` function.</s>
