You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its cyclic dependencies.
<</SYS>>

Please analyze and provide details on the cyclic dependencies in a Python program.
-Definition: Cyclic dependency analysis involves understanding how dependencies form cycles within different parts of the program.

-Example Scenario: Consider a program that involves multiple modules with interdependent imports. Analyze the cyclic dependencies to identify how modules are interconnected in a cyclic manner.


Now, based on the given information, please share the cyclic dependency analysis details by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The given code is a C program that interchanges the elements of the first and last rows of a matrix. The program has a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a matrix as input and swaps the elements of the first and last rows. The function is called from the `main` function, which also prints the input and output matrices.

To analyze the cyclic dependencies in the program, we need to identify the dependencies between the different parts of the code. In this case, the dependencies are between the `main` function, the `interchangeFirstLast` function, and the matrix itself.

The `main` function depends on the `interchangeFirstLast` function, as it calls the function to swap the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix. The `interchangeFirstLast` function depends on the matrix, as it takes the matrix as input and swaps the elements of the first and last rows. Finally, the matrix itself depends on the `main` function and the `interchangeFirstLast` function, as it is used as input to the `interchangeFirstLast` function and its elements are swapped by the function.

Therefore, the cyclic dependencies in the program are:

* `main` function depends on `interchangeFirstLast` function
* `interchangeFirstLast` function depends on the matrix
* Matrix depends on `main` function and `interchangeFirstLast` function

These dependencies form a cycle, where the `main` function calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function, which depends on the matrix, which in turn depends on the `main` function and the `interchangeFirstLast` function. This cycle is the cyclic dependency in the program.</s>
