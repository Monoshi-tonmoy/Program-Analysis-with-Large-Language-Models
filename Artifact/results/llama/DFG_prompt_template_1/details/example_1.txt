You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int A, B, sum = 0;

    // Ask user to enter the two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers A and B : \n");

    // Read two numbers from the user || A = 2, B = 3
    scanf("%d%d", &A, &B);

    // Calculate the addition of A and B
    // using '+' operator
    sum = A + B;

    // Print the sum
    printf("Sum of A and B is: %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  Sure, here's the dataflow information for the program:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines three variables: `A`, `B`, and `sum`. `A` and `B` are integers, and `sum` is an integer that will be used to store the sum of `A` and `B`.
3. The program then asks the user to enter two numbers, `A` and `B`, using the `printf` function.
4. The program then reads the two numbers from the user using the `scanf` function. The `%d` format specifier is used to read an integer value. The `&` operator is used to pass the address of the `A` and `B` variables to `scanf`, so that the function can store the input values in the variables.
5. The program then calculates the sum of `A` and `B` using the `+` operator. The result is stored in the `sum` variable.
6. The program then prints the sum using the `printf` function. The `%d` format specifier is used to print an integer value.
7. The program then returns 0 to indicate that it has completed successfully.

Overall, the program takes input from the user, performs a simple calculation, and then prints the result to the console.</s>
