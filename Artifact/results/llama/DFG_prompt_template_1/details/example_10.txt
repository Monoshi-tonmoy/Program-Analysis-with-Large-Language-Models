Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement the above approach
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find factorial of given number
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
	int result = 1, i;

	// loop from 2 to n to get the factorial
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		result *= i;
	}

	return result;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 5;
	printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, factorial(num));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The program then defines a function called `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`.
3. The `factorial` function initializes a variable `result` to 1 and a variable `i` to 2.
4. The `factorial` function then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n`, inclusive. In each iteration, the function multiplies `result` by `i` and updates `result` with the result.
5. After the loop, the `factorial` function returns `result`.
6. The program then defines a `main` function that takes no arguments and returns an integer.
7. The `main` function initializes a variable `num` to 5 and then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as an argument.
8. The `main` function then uses the `printf` function to print the result of the `factorial` function to the console.
9. The `main` function then returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.
