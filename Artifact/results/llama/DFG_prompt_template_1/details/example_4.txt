Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program interchange the elements
// of first and last in a matrix
// across rows.
#include <stdio.h>

#define n 3

// Function to swap the element
// of first and last row
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
{
    int rows = n;

    // Swapping of element between first
    // and last rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input matrix
    int m[n][n] = {{6, 3, 1},
                   {4, 5, 2},
                   {2, 4, 9}};

    // Printing the input matrix
    printf("Input Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // call interchangeFirstLast(m) function.
    // This function swap the element of
    // first and last row
    interchangeFirstLast(m);

    // Printing the original matrix
    printf("\nOutput Matrix: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");

``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program defines a macro `n` with the value 3, which is used to specify the size of the matrix.
3. The program defines a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a matrix as input and swaps the elements of the first and last rows.
4. The function first calculates the number of rows in the matrix and then loops through the elements of the first and last rows, swapping them.
5. The program then defines a driver code that creates a 3x3 matrix and prints it to the console.
6. The program then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function on the matrix, which swaps the elements of the first and last rows.
7. The program then prints the original matrix and the modified matrix to the console.
