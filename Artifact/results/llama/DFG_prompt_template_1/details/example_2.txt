You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program for the even or odd
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check if a 
// number is even or odd
void checkEvenOdd(int N) {
    // Find remainder
    int r = N % 2;

    // Condition for even
    if (r == 0)  {
        printf("Even");
    }

    // Otherwise
    else {
        printf("Odd");
    }
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The program then defines a function called `checkEvenOdd` that takes an integer argument `N`.
3. The function first calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`).
4. The function then checks if the remainder is equal to 0. If it is, the function prints "Even" to the console.
5. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function prints "Odd" to the console.
6. The function then returns, and the program ends.

Note that the program does not use any global variables or arrays, so the dataflow is relatively simple.</s>
