Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to demonstrate the
// area and perimeter of rectangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int l = 10, b = 10;
	printf("Area of rectangle is : %d", l * b);
	printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is : %d", 2 * (l + b));
	return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  Sure! Here's the dataflow information for the program:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions.
2. The `main` function is declared, which is the entry point of the program.
3. The `l` and `b` variables are declared and initialized to 10.
4. The `printf` function is used to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle to the console. The `%d` format specifier is used to print the values of `l * b` and `2 * (l + b)` as integers.
5. The `return 0` statement is used to indicate that the program has completed successfully.

Overall, the program calculates the area and per<s>
