Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C Program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion 
#include <stdio.h> 

// first two values 
int prev1 = 1; 
int prev2 = 0; 

// recursive function to print the fibonacci series 
void fib(int n) 
{ 
	if (n < 3) { 
		return; 
	} 
	int fn = prev1 + prev2; 
	prev2 = prev1; 
	prev1 = fn; 
	printf("%d ", fn); 
	return fib(n - 1); 
} 

// function that handles the first two terms and calls the 
// recursive function 
void printFib(int n) 
{ 
	// when the number of terms is less than 1 
	if (n < 1) { 
		printf("Invalid number of terms\n"); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 1 
	else if (n == 1) { 
		printf("%d ", 0); 
	} 
	// when the number of terms is 2 
	else if (n == 2) { 
		printf("%d %d", 0, 1); 
	} 
	// number of terms greater than 2 
	else { 
		printf("%d %d ", 0, 1); 
		fib(n); 
	} 
	return; 
} 

// driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int n = 9; 
	printFib(n); 
	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides functions for input and output.
2. The program then defines two global variables, `prev1` and `prev2`, which are used to store the previous two values in the Fibonacci series.
3. The program then defines a recursive function, `fib`, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function works by first checking if `n` is less than 3, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number by adding the previous two values and then updates the previous two values.
4. The program then defines a function, `printFib`, which takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. The function works by first checking if `n` is less than 1, in which case it prints an error message. Otherwise, it prints the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and then calls the `fib` function to print the remaining Fibonacci numbers.
5. The program then defines a `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. The `main` function first sets the value of `n` to 9 and then calls the `printFib` function to print the first 9 Fibonacci numbers.
6. The program then ends by returning 0, which indicates that the program executed successfully.</s>
