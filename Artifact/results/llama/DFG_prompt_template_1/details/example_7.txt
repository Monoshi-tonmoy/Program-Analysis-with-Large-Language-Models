Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to implement 
// the above approach 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	// We can change values here for 
	// different inputs 
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; 

	// Calculate simple interest 
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 

	// Print Simple Interest 
	printf("Simple Interest = %f\n", SI); 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The program you provided is a C program that calculates the simple interest of a principal amount (P) for a given time (T) and interest rate (R). The program uses the formula:

Simple Interest = (P \* T \* R) / 100

The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file, which provides input/output functions. The program then defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

Inside the `main` function, the program first declares three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which are the principal amount, interest rate, and time, respectively. The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula mentioned above and stores it in the `SI` variable.

Finally, the program prints the simple interest using the `printf` function and returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by including the `stdio.h` header file.
2. The program then defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
3. Inside the `main` function, the program declares three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`.
4. The program then calculates the simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`.
5. The program then prints the simple interest using the `printf` function.
6. The program returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>
