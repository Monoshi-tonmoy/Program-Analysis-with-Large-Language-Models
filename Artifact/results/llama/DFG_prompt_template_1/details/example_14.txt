You are a Program Analyst. Users will provide you with a program, and you will analyze its dataflow.

Please share the dataflow information of a program by enclosing the code in triple backticks: 
```
// C program to find LCM of 
// two numbers 
#include <stdio.h> 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int x = 15, y = 25, max; 
	max = (x > y) ? x : y; 

	// While loop to check if max variable 
	// is divisible by x and y 
	while (1) { 
		if (max % x == 0 && max % y == 0) { 
			printf("The LCM of %d and %d is %d.", x, y, 
				max); 
			break; 
		} 

		++max; 
	} 

	return 0; 
}
``` [/INST]  The dataflow of the program is as follows:

1. The program starts by declaring three variables: `x`, `y`, and `max`.
2. The program then initializes `x` and `y` to 15 and 25, respectively.
3. The program then calculates the maximum of `x` and `y` and stores it in the `max` variable.
4. The program then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely.
5. Inside the while loop, the program checks if `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.
6. If `max` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program prints a message to the console and exits the loop.
7. If `max` is not divisible by both `x` and `y`, the program increments `max` by 1 and repeats the loop.
8. The program then exits the loop and returns 0.
