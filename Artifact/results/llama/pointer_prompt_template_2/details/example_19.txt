Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int pure_memcmp(const void *const b1_, const void *const b2_, size_t len) {
   const unsigned char *b1 = (const unsigned char *) b1_;
   const unsigned char *b2 = (const unsigned char *) b2_;
   size_t i;
   unsigned char d = (unsigned char) 0 U;
   for (i = 0 U; i < len; i++) {
        d |= b1[i] ^ b2[i];
   }
   return (int)((1 &((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1);
}

int pure_strcmp(const char *const s1, const char *const s2) {
    return pure_memcmp(s1, s2, strlen(s1) + 1 U);
}
``` [/INST]  There are several potential issues with the provided code:

1. The `pure_memcmp` function is not type-safe, as it takes two `void *` pointers as arguments, which can be any type of pointer. This can lead to type errors and undefined behavior if the pointers are not of the correct type.
2. The `pure_memcmp` function uses a loop to compare the bytes of the two memory blocks, but it does not check for the end of the blocks. If the blocks are not the same size, this can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior.
3. The `pure_strcmp` function calls `pure_memcmp` with the `strlen` of the first string as the length argument, but this can be incorrect if the strings are not the same length. This can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior.
4. The `pure_strcmp` function does not check for the end of the strings, and it does not handle the case where the strings are not the same length. This can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior.
5. The `pure_memcmp` function uses a bitwise OR operation to combine the bytes of the two memory blocks, but this can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior if the blocks are not the same size.
6. The `pure_memcmp` function uses a cast to convert the result of the bitwise OR operation to an `int`, but this can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior if the result is not representable as an `int`.
7. The `pure_strcmp` function uses a cast to convert the result of the `pure_memcmp` function to an `int`, but this can lead to a buffer overflow and undefined behavior if the result is not representable as an `int`.

To fix these issues, the code should be rewritten to use type-safe pointers and to check for the end of the memory blocks and strings. The `pure_memcmp` function should also be rewritten to use a safer method for comparing the bytes of the memory blocks, such as using a `memcmp` function that takes the length of the blocks as an argument. The `pure_strcmp` function should also be rewritten to check for the end of the strings and to handle the case where the strings are not the same length.</s>
