Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
struct Ex {
    int field;
};

int fun5(struct Ex *d) {
    int val;
    if (d->field) 
        val = 1;

    if (d->field)
        val = 2;
    return 0;
}
``` [/INST]  There are several potential issues with the pointer use in the code snippet you provided:

1. The `d` pointer is not checked for null before it is dereferenced. This can cause a segmentation fault if the pointer is null.
2. The `field` member of the `struct Ex` is not checked for null before it is dere<s>
3. The `val` variable is not initialized before it is used. This can cause undefined behavior if the `field` member is null.
4. The `fun5` function does not return a value in all code paths. This can cause undefined behavior if the function is called with a null pointer.
5. The `fun5` function does not check for null pointer before dereferencing the `d` pointer. This can cause a segmentation fault if the pointer is null.
6. The `fun5` function does not check for null pointer before dereferencing the `field` member. This can cause a segment<s>

It is recommended to check for null pointer before dereferencing any pointer and to initialize variables before using them.</s>
