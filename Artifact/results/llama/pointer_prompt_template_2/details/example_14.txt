Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);
  if(modified != 0) {
    printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
    printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
``` [/INST]  Yes, there are several potential issues with the pointer use in the code:

1. The `gets` function is dangerous and should not be used. It is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks and can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
2. The `volatile` keyword is not necessary in this case, as the `modified` variable is not being modified by an interrupt or signal handler.
3. The `buffer` variable is not initialized, which means it contains random data. This can cause the `gets` function to read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
4. The `printf` function is not being used correctly. The format string should be a string literal, not a variable.
5. The `main` function is not being used correctly. It should return an `int` value, not a `void` value.

Here is an example of how the code could be rewritten to fix these issues:
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char buffer[64];
  int modified = 0;
  printf("Enter a string: ");
  fgets(buffer, 64, stdin);
  if (modified != 0) {
    printf("You have changed the 'mod<s>
```
This code uses the `fgets` function to read a string from the standard input, and it uses the `printf` function to print a message to the standard output. It also initializes the `buffer` variable to an empty string, which prevents the `gets` function from reading beyond the end of the buffer.

Note that this code is still vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, as the `fgets` function can still read beyond the end of the buffer if the user enters a string that is too long. To prevent this, you should use a safer function such as `fgets_s` or `gets_s`, which can be found in the `string.h` header file.</s>
