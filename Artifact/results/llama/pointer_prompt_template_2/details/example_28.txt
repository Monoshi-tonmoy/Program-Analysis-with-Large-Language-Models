Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)

int contains_char(char c){
    char *str;
    str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
    while( *str != NULL){
        if( *str == c ){
            /* matched char, free string and return success */
            free(str);
            return SUCCESS;
        }
        /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
        str = str + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */

    free(str);
    return FAILURE;
}
``` [/INST]  There are several potential issues with the pointer use in the code:

1. The `str` pointer is not initialized before it is used in the `strcpy` function. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
2. The `str` pointer is not freed before the function returns. This can cause a memory leak, which can lead to a variety of problems, including crashes, hangs, and other unexpected behavior.
3. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is used in the `strcpy` function. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpected<s>
4. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is freed. This can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.
5. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is returned. This can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.
6. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is used in the `strcmp` function. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
7. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is used in the `free` function. This can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.
8. The `str` pointer is not checked for NULL before it is used in the `return` statement. This can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.

It's also worth noting that the `str` pointer is not freed before the function returns, which can cause a memory leak.
