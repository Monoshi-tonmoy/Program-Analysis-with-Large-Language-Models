Are there any potential issues with the following pointer use? 
```
int send_msg(char *ptr, int len) {
    while(i < len) {
        buf_write_msg(ptr + i);
        i++;
    }
    free(ptr);
    return i;
}

int tx_int(char *ptr) {
    int val = OBJ_SIZE;
    while(val < OBJ_SIZE) {
        send_msg(ptr, 16);
    }
    free(ptr);
}
``` [/INST]  There are several potential issues with the pointer use in the code you provided:

1. The `send_msg` function takes a `char *` pointer as an argument, but it does not check whether the pointer is valid before using it. If the pointer is null or points to an invalid memory location, the function may crash or cause undefined behavior.
2. The `send_<s>	msg` function frees the `ptr` pointer after using it, but it does not check whether the pointer was allocated dynamically or not. If the pointer was not allocated dynamically, the function may cause a memory leak or undefined behavior.
3. The `tx_int` function takes a `char *` pointer as an argument, but it does not check whether the pointer is valid before using it. If the pointer is null or points to an invalid memory location, the function may crash or cause undefined behavior.
4. The `tx_int` function frees the `ptr` pointer after using it, but it does not check whether the pointer was allocated dynamically or not. If the pointer was not allocated dynamically, the function may cause a memory leak or undefined behavior.
5. The `tx_int` function uses the `OBJ_SIZE` macro to determine the size of the object being sent, but it does not check whether the macro is defined or not. If the macro is not defined, the function may cause a compilation error or undefined behavior.
6. The `tx_int` function uses the `buf_write_msg` function to write the message to the buffer, but it does not check whether the function was successful or not. If the function fails, the function may cause a memory leak or undefined behavior.

To fix these issues, you should check the pointer arguments for validity before using them, and make sure that the pointers are allocated dynamically or not as appropriate. You should also check the return value of the `buf_write_msg` function to ensure that it was successful. Additionally, you should define the `OBJ_SIZE` macro and use it consistently throughout the code.</s>
